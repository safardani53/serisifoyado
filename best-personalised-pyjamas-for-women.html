We love the close-up portrait style as shown in their photo but you could do any type of pose that you can bribe your dog into!</p><h2>Where can I buy personalised pyjamas?</h2><p>Personalised pyjamas are not your run of the mill pyjamas and are not frequently seen in stores but are hugely available online. Celebrities love them! And you can find many web stores with different styles, colours and types to suit your needs. From satin sets to shorts to cotton personalised pyjamas there is something for everyone. One of the most well known personalised stores is <a href=#>HA Designs</a>, but you can also find other personalised pyjamas on sites such as <a href=#>Super Socks</a>, <a href=#>Bathrobes UK</a>, and <a href=#>Etsy stores.</a></p><h2>How often should you change your pyjamas?</h2><p>The great debate with a variation of views. But how often should you really change your pyjamas? Research from the Clean Living Institute suggest pyjamas should be changed and subsequently washed after three to four uses. It is recommended they are changed regularly similar to towels and pillow cases to reduce the risk of dust mites, and other germs and bacteria that can cling to pyjamas. When we sleep we shed dead skin cells, and every hour we shed approximately&nbsp;1,500,000 dead skin flakes. So over eight hours of sleep can be over 12,000,000 dead skin flakes!</p><h2>Do pyjamas keep you cool?</h2><p>We've all been there. It's hot and sweaty in the nighttime and sheets can get in a tangled mess. But if you wear pyjamas with natural fibres they can actually keep you cool. 100% cotton, silk and bamboo are the best-known fibres that regulate your body temperature keeping you cool as you sleep. If you are prone to getting very hot in the nighttime then it is best not to go for fabrics like polyester or satin, as these don't help, and definitely do not opt for fleecy pj's!</p><h2>Are satin pyjamas warm?</h2><p>While pure silk will keep you cool due to its natural materials, satin is woven from nylon and polyester which will actually keep in the heat. While satin pyjamas may look cool and even feel it on initial touch, they are a man-made fibre so will keep you warm at night.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More From Sun Selects Fashion</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the best flared personalised pyjamas?
