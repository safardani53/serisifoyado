He creates cutting-edge content that is simultaneously family-friendly.</p><p>Being a father to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> ten&nbsp;kids</a>&nbsp;has to have its perks, and for Wayne, the content they provide to flesh out his routines is one such bonus. The comedian’s sketches revolve around his personal life and his baby mamas. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They range from him sharing funny experiences from the time he had to do odd jobs to provide for his family to his currently dating a woman - Rolonda Rochelle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His ex-girlfriend Jessica Moore&nbsp;can also be seen&nbsp;in many of his recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sketches</a>, as the two seem to have a friendly bond even after their fallout. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Details: Father to 10 Kids From His Relationship With 5+ Baby Mamas</h2><p>As mentioned above, Wayne, who is 33-year-old is a father of 10 kids — and he gave birth to his children from his relationship with at least 5 [revealed] women.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Speaking with DJsmallz Eyes in July 2017 - when he had 8 kids only - the comedian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that he had his first child in 12th grade at the age of 17. A year later, he gave birth to his second child, and by 19, he had three kids. Following that, in a few years, he was the father to all those kids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He further revealed that those 8 kids were from his 5 different relationships with 5 baby mothers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The comedian also stated that he maintained good relationships with his baby mamas, but he did not reveal their identities.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But now, in 2021, he is the father to two more kids whose mothers are yet to be disclosed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Amongst his many relationships, Wayne <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> his girlfriend, Gena Coller, in 2017, a mother to his one daughter.

The reason behind this cognizance was because the music wasn’t making him money, and he couldn’t afford to fool around with the responsibilities of ten&nbsp;kids on his shoulders.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When the interviewer asked him about his first stand-up comedy gig and his struggles, he mentioned he got paid $3500 for his first show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Years later, now, Wayne <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">manages</a> a luxurious lifestyle and spends quality time with his kids and his baby mamas with his earned net worth.
