He was even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recognized</a> as one of the best young players in South Bay, California after he&nbsp;led his school team (Sweetwater High)&nbsp;to the South Bay semi-finals in 1985 and 1986. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, in 1987, the Greater San Diego Area&nbsp;native made a huge <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">splash</a> in the news after he averaged 30 points for his first two games. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But unfortunately he had to seat on the bench for the next 13 games because he failed to meet the standard grades, and was, thus, declared ineligible to play.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And when he&nbsp;returned 13 games later to lead his high school team into the playoffs, his&nbsp;absent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">record</a> set a black mark on his future career, as he was not the same player he used to be before. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">San Diego Union Tribune</a> in June 2020, he remembered his&nbsp;playing days and said, "I never could catch up," while&nbsp;clarifying&nbsp;on why he gave up on his basketball career.</p><p>However, in his overall playing career,&nbsp;Williams finished with a total of 1,932 points while averaging double figures in rebounds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span>Mahlon Williams Focused on His Education and Coaching Career After Ending His Playing Career</span></h2><p><span>After his playing career came to an end,&nbsp;Mahlon Willams placed education in his&nbsp;paramount importance list. Thus, he studied and subsequently earned a&nbsp;Bachelor's </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>degree</span></a><span> in Criminal Justice from National University. Later, he also went on to receive a Master's degree in human behavior and sports psychology.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>Using his master's degree, Williams went back to his old high school,&nbsp;Sweetwater High, and spent&nbsp;13 years working as&nbsp;an instructor. Meanwhile, he also&nbsp;worked for the San Diego Job Corps.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Following that, the National University graduate ran&nbsp;girls youth basketball program as well as coached&nbsp;the boys with&nbsp;current San Ysidro head coach Terry Tucker for 10 years.</p><p>His initiation of&nbsp;girls youth basketball program was in collaboration with&nbsp;the Compton/San Diego Magic. There, he looked after the young girls'&nbsp;travel planning,&nbsp;scouting, recruiting, and college placement. While doing so, he has sent over 80 girls to collage with&nbsp;$17 million in scholarships, so far.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As a Coach, He Led His Son's Team To High School Title Win</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>Mahlon Willams has also played a valuable role in paving a path for many young future athletes, including his own son&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mikey</a> Williams.</span></p><p><span>When son Willams (Mikey) was in his sixth grade and associated with&nbsp;Malcolm Thomas All-Stars team, father Willams (Malcolm) turned up as a coach for the team.
