Shady.<br></p><h3>Leighton Thomas</h3><p>Leighton is the most obvious suspect, as far as the police are concerned, because he killed a man 20 years ago.</p><p>After serving his time, and gaining a degree behind bars, he moved to Loch Ness to start a new life and now runs a successful boat tour business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/140886-fac916cf-4b3a-46c8-8bdd-edee68b36d44.jpg><p>Not many people know about his past â€”&nbsp;but did Niall?</p><p>The ex-jailbird has an alibi for the time of the murder, but it seems there's a lot more of his story to be unravelled yet.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Leighton is played by</a> William Ash, who's also known for Waterloo Road and Where The Heart Is.</p><h2>What is the storyline of The Loch?</h2><p>In a community nourished and sustained by myth and bordered by untamed nature, the search for a serial killer becomes a matter of life and death for local detective Annie Redford who is trying to cope with her first murder case.</p><p>When the body of local man Niall Swift is found at the foot of Carn Mohr Mountain and an isolated human heart on the loch shore, the tranquillity of he town is shattered and a nightmare begins.</p><p>Within the tight-knit community, several local characters come under suspicion as the monster lurking in their midst begins to terrify and rock the village to its core.</p><p>Maverick forensic profiler Blake Albrighton assists on the case, offering insights drawn from the last four cases heâ€™s cracked.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in tv and showbiz</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhraGuCeX6VaKuhnV2hvKS0jKasq5yVp7KzedKuqqmdk6nAbrXTr2SkoZyhsrN5wJumrqxdm7avrcueZKShlaeur3nWoaCtnZiarqV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./barbie-forteza-19970731-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbie Forteza (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
