Richard was one of the most important figures in the Blaxploitation movement of the 1970s, and he had a fine career in Hollywood in the decades after he first played John Shaft.</p><p>After hearing that he had died, though, many wanted to learn more about Richard's death, and about what his net worth was at the time of his passing.

Richard worked consistently in the industry for nearly 50 years, so it's unclear why the estimates of his net worth were so low. It's possible, of course, that these estimates aren't an accurate reflection of how much wealth he had accumulated.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Richard Roundtree</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $2 Million</p><p>Richard Roundtree was an American actor best known for playing John Shaft in Shaft and its subsequent sequels.

He had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and openly discussed it after his double mastectomy.</p><p>“Breast cancer is not gender specific,” he said. “And men have this cavalier attitude about health issues. I got such positive feedback because I spoke out about it, and it’s been quite a number of years now. I’m a survivor.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Working with Richard Roundtree was a dream.

He was a part of the 1977 blockbuster miniseries Roots, where he played Sam Bennett, the carriage driver who falls for Kizzy. He also starred opposite Peter O'Toole in Man Friday and worked opposite Laurence Olivier in Inchon.</p><p>Whenever you consider the history of Black representation on American movie screens, Richard's name is almost guaranteed to come up.
