He seemed like an absolute dream. He told me he had a car, a dog, a lovely neighbour down the road who he’d go and visit, and he said he had his own place.</p><p>“He told me he wrote songs for Sony too and he seemed like the perfect guy and it was too good to be true.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on AJ Bunker">Read More on AJ Bunker</h2><p>AJ, who admitted said she hadn’t slept with anyone for two years before him, said alarm bells started ringing when she went to his flat and “something didn’t feel right.”</p><p>She continued: “I put his address to find out where he lived and the YMCA came up. I then went to look for his business and put it in Companies House, nothing came up.</p><p>“He said he’d written a particular song for One Republic and again nothing came up. It was traumatising.”</p><p>The star explained that it was at her recent birthday when she confronted him about his lies and he admitted he hadn’t been truthful.</p><p>She said: “He told me he’d lied because he didn’t think I’d give him the time of the day if he’d told me the truth.</p><p>“He said he’d fallen in love with me, but he said he’d lied about having a dog and only said it because I’d told him I loved animals. He admitted he didn’t have a car and didn’t even have a license.</p><p>“By this point I was traumatised and called it a day. I trusted him at first because why would I ever have questioned it. I trusted him.”</p><p>After she’d ended her relationship AJ explained that she blocked him on every platform so that he couldn’t contact her.</p><p>“He would come with me to events and got introduced to all the people in my industry, like producers and influencers and celebrities,” AJ added, saying he even got signed to her agent.</p><p>The situation escalated for the star as she explained he “stole thousands” from her and her agent.</p><p>Then one day AJ got a call from a friend telling her to search a name on the internet which she did, only to discover her boyfriend was a gay porn star.</p><p>AJ continued: “It was extreme porn. It was all with men and I could see as clear as day that it was him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>“I was absolutely mortified and I didn’t think it could get any worse and then I discovered that. He’d even asked one of my gay friends to send him photos.”</p><p>The star said he’d also left a girls’ thong in her house which she discovered when moving his things out of her home.</p><p>“My friends sent me a picture of an ugly thong rolled up in a ball and put into his hoodie. I couldn’t believe he’d been bringing underwear to my house and leaving it there.”</p><p>AJ admits she’s been left “terrified” by the situation and said he’d “used her” to elevate himself into the public eye.</p><p>She said: “He’d come with me to events and be so possessive and controlling.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The <a href=#>Love Island star</a> compared her former boyfriend to the infamous Tinder Swindler, and said she wants to raise awareness for people dating to “be careful” of who they’re getting to know.</p><p>She added: “I want people to be aware and know that sometimes people aren’t always who they say they are.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000732124635.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpaWuAdX%2BUbWaaol2Xwq%2B3xKuqZqugoba1v4yfqailXZ2ys3nBqLCfqpmau6V5xpqwZqifp7tuv9OaqWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./5unf9ceys19ysh4rcmwpres-h4bhbbnp.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Under The Dome Season 3 Episode 13: The Enemy Within">&larr;
