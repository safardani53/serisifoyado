Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on March 12 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>.

Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Actor best known for his supporting roles in the films Gone Baby Gone, Argo, The Town and Transformers: Age of Extinction.
