Life is short. I just don’t want my brother to have any regrets.”</p><p>In true Teresa fashion, she brought it up during a family gathering. Thankfully, she did not throw some tables. She’s learned from her mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Things started to get heated during the dinner party, with Joe’s father Giacinto yelling about his son not calling him, going as far as saying “F–k you” to him.&nbsp;</p><p>“Are you going to be around more for this one? He wants you around more,” she said. “The kid that’s not around the most, that’s the kid you always want.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/joe-gorga-poses-682x1024.jpg><p>Melissa who has feuded with Teresa in the past because of her association with her brother took to a confessional to complain about the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><p>“Who brings up a super sensitive, going-to-cause-a-problem conversation on Easter Sunday? Especially in front of my father-in-law, who is super upset as it is,” she asked.</p><p>“This is definitely not the day, the time, the place. Like, your timing sucks.”</p><p>“Not on Easter,” Melissa added.</p><p>“This conversation gets my skin crawling because I get instant flashbacks of the pain that Joe went through years ago over conversations that were similar.”</p><p>“I know my husband. When you push him, and you constantly say the same thing to him over and over again, I know he’s going to explode. Joe is a ticking time bomb. It’s going to happen.”</p><p>Joe made it clear that he was getting sick of the way Teresa was acting.&nbsp;</p><p>“You gotta cut that out,” he snapped at Teresa.</p><p>“You always bring that up in front of Daddy. ‘Oh you work too much, you’re not around.’ Listen to me, if I was sitting in a bar all day, if I was sitting in restaurants, that’s a different story. But what am I going to do? When you put in 15 hours a day, hard work? I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“You know my life. You know the business, it’s crazy. I work hardcore, all day, every day, nonstop. Unbelievable stresses,” Joe added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“My business takes all my freakin time. Is he going to pay my bills? No one pays my bills. What am I going to do, just give it all up?”</p><p>That was not all Teresa had to say, however.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m just saying, he bitches to me all the time,” she complained. “I got to hear him! ‘Your brother don’t call me. It’s been five days.’“</p><p>“Since I’ve lost my mom, holidays are more emotional. I’m just trying to make the holiday as best as I can for my dad. I just want to make him happy. He needs that,” Teresa said, addressing the cameras.</p><p>“Before I went away, I spent a lot of time with my mom. And right now all I can think about is how when I came home, I wished I spent more time with my mom. So it’s frustrating that my brother makes the effort to see my dad just on a holiday.”</p><p>Teresa’s daughter, Gia, turned to her uncle Joe with her take on what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not fair,” said the teenager. “We get it so much from Nonno, you don’t even know. I know you have work, trust me, I know. But if you don’t call him for a day, he says something. … At least just try, in a week, just one designated day for Nonno.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But there was no getting through to Joe who maintained that he was a busy man.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t give a s—,” yelled Teresa. “You have to make time. In life, that’s how it is. Capeesh?”</p><p>While the fighting simmered down and everyone enjoyed the rest of the day, Joe confirmed in a confessional that he was mad at his sister.&nbsp;</p><p>“Teresa was always like this when we were kids,” Joe admitted. “When it came to me, she would rat me out. Why are you still doing this? It’s going to cause a big problem again, which we don’t need.”</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough drama, Margaret informed Danielle that she was going to an event hosted by Dolores and things got a little bit crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>“She invited me to this thing–,” said Margaret BUT Danielle butted in.&nbsp;</p><p>“And you coulda said, ‘No, I’m not coming because that will make Danielle very upset and very hurt. It’ll hurt her!’ Because you coulda said, ‘This would hurt me if the tables were turned.’ You coulda said anything but, ‘Yes, I’ll come.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As Margaret tried to calm Danielle down, the former main cast member decided to storm off, but she came back with a parting shot:</p><p>“What is it that you two really have in common? You cheated on your husband, and she got cheated on?”</p><p>That has got to be one of the best one-liners in the history of the series, and just like that, it looks like another friendship is over.&nbsp;</p><p>What are your thoughts on all the drama?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real Housewives of New Jersey continues Mondays on Bravo.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Danielle Staub: Accused of Financial, Verbal AND Emotional Abuse … by Her Own …</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z%2BcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpZ6vXZ%2Bys7%2FEsmSsnZGovK95mGacqaGjpLGmeZFmqZ6bkaV6tbHRnqpo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-richs-wife-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is John Rich Dating  John Rich's Wife &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
