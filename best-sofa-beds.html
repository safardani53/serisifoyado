We've seen great budget options in the region of £200 to £300, our top pick being the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eliza Sofa Bed from Bensons For Beds</a>.<br>But if your budget can allow for it, there are some incredible bespoke options and more permanent solutions that will cost around £700-£1,500, and our favourite is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span class=product-name--brand>Inspire</span> Malton 3 Seater&nbsp;sofa bed from SCS.</a></p><h2>Is there an alternative to a sofa bed?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you want to explore more options other than a sofa bed, then you don't need to settle; there are plenty of solutions out there. One nifty solution is the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jay-Be footstool sofa from Robert Dyas</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, which takes up much less space and is unassuming, meaning it will fit into any space.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>You could also opt for a day bed, which is smaller than your average mattress, but a more permanent option.</span></p><h2>Do you need a special mattress for a sofa bed?</h2><p>Most sofa beds come with thinner and more flexible mattresses than you would find on the average bed, which makes them easier to store away when not in use.</p><p>You can opt for sofa beds with pocket-sprung mattresses that are of higher quality. But there are also modular sofa beds that use sofa cushions as a mattress, which is surprisingly comfortable.</p><h2><strong>Can you sleep on a sofa bed every night?</strong></h2><p>If you're planning to sleep on a sofa bed every night, we would suggest choosing a full-size sofa bed for maximum comfort.</p><p>Look out for a hardwood frame for durability and a comfortable mattress.</p><p>The best sofa beds also have storage space where you can keep all the bedding you need too.</p><h2><strong>What should I look for when buying a sofa bed?</strong></h2><p>There are a few things you should consider before buying a sofa bed.</p><p>Make sure you measure the space accordingly with your chosen bed in mind, considering both its folded and unfolded measurements.</p><p>Look out for beds with hardwood frames and pay attention to the fillings: a feather-filled sofa offers good comfort for seating, but if you're planning on regularly using your new sofa as a bed, a foam filling and decent mattress are the way to go.</p><h2>Where to buy a sofa bed in the UK</h2><p>The best shop for you will very much depend on your own preference, how quickly you want your sofa bed delivered and your budget.</p><p>We suggest you compare prices and styles online before heading to the shops to find your favourite one.</p><h2><strong>What are the different types of sofa beds?</strong></h2><p>Sofa beds are generally divided into two main categories - the clic-clac mechanism and the pull-out frame.</p><p>The first one gets its name from the sound it makes when the bed is folded and unfolded.</p><p>Clic clac sofa beds tend to have fewer cushions and smaller armrests to make it easier to transform them from bed to sofa and vice versa.</p><p>They are usually easier to use and cheaper than the pull-out frame version but tend to look more like sofa beds than sofas.</p><p>The more traditional pull-out frame usually has a roll‐up mattress that's hidden inside the sofa when not in use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFqaWqDdIOOm5ysrF2ovKetjJucnatf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-henwick-ethnicity-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Jessica Henwicks Ethnicity, Parents, And Siblings">&larr;
