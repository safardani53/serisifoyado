Nevertheless, he has offered a few glimpses of his father and mother on his social media.</p><p>For instance, on May 10, 2021, the actor shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">series</a> of two pictures on his Instagram. The first picture depicted a cherished childhood moment with his mother and sister, while the second showcased them in a more recent phase of their lives as they have grown older.</p><p>He accompanied the pictures with a simple yet heartfelt caption that read, “There are things that remain constant, and one of them is my love for you, Mom.”</p><p>Following the post, there was an outpouring of affectionate comments from his fans and followers. One person wrote, “This is so beautiful; sending you all my best wishes,’ while another individual remarked, “Admiring those precious faces,” alongside numerous heart emojis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, on June 20, 2021, Inaki shared a nostalgic throwback picture featuring himself and his father. In the heartfelt caption, he expressed gratitude to his father for dressing him as Pooh on his birthday, and he extended warm wishes for a happy Father’s Day.</p><p>The actor also offers a glimpse into his joyful childhood. For instance, on May 1, 2021, Inaki shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">childhood</a> picture of himself engrossed in painting with colors.&nbsp;</p><p>In his caption, he humorously admitted, “I almost forgot today is Children’s Day; I guess that means I’m growing up, nooooooooo! Happy Children’s Day!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inaki Godoy shares a close bond with his sister, Mia Godoy&nbsp;</h2><p>Inaki’s younger sibling, Mia, is a professional <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sailor</a>. The brother-sister duo appears to share a close bond, evident from a childhood picture Inaki <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> on September 8, 2018. In this endearing snapshot, he was seen sucking on a pacifier while cradling his baby sister.</p><p>Similarly, the actor frequently shares pictures with his sister on his Instagram. For example, on May 7, 2021, he posted a series of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pictures</a> capturing their delightful moments while having fun at a museum.</p><p>Moreover, Inaki not only shares a close bond with his sister but also actively supports each other’s careers. In a post dated April 13, 2023, he expressed deep gratitude for the unwavering support and encouragement that Mia has consistently provided him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sister-1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Inaki Godoy has an incredibly supportive younger sister in Mia Godoy. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>While sharing a picture of them on the ship, the actor revealed that his decision to embark on this ship adventure was influenced by various factors, with one of the most significant inspirations being his younger sister.</p><p>He conveyed that his sister has been an indispensable role model throughout his life. He also disclosed that Mia had been at sea for nearly a year now, and having experienced the challenges of such a journey, he expressed his immense pride in her.&nbsp;</p><p>In the final words of the caption, Inaki stated that he misses her dearly and can’t wait to see her soon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inaki Godoy remains mum about his dating life&nbsp;</h2><p>As of now, Inaki seems to be single. He usually maintains a degree of privacy regarding his dating life. Taking a glance at his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, the actor has indeed shared pictures with a few female co-stars and friends.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/friedn.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Inaki Godoy and Roby Damián are simply close friends. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>For instance, on September 13, 2019, he posted a series of pictures, including one with Roby Damián, and captioned it with heartfelt gratitude, “We made it! Thank you for this incredible experience. I will miss you all so much. See you soon!”</p><p>However, none of Inaki’s pictures with female companions suggest that he is in a romantic relationship. There have also been no reports linking him to any of his female co-stars.</p><p>As the actor currently finds himself at the pinnacle of his career, his primary <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">focus</a> appears to be on his professional projects rather than actively seeking a romantic partner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inaki Godoy maintains an impressive physique&nbsp;</h2><p>Inaki stands at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">height</a> of 5 feet 7 inches and weighs approximately 60 kg. Undoubtedly, he achieves and sustains his remarkable physique through consistent exercise and a balanced diet, but he has chosen not to disclose his specific workout routine publicly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, as an actor undertaking physically demanding roles like Monkey D. Luffy in the Netflix One Piece, which involves executing challenging stunts and action sequences, Inaki places a strong <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emphasis</a> on flexibility and mobility workouts to enhance his performance.</p><p>Furthermore, the actor frequently shares pictures of himself engaging in various outdoor activities, such as hiking, swimming, and more, on his Instagram. For instance, on October 1, 2022, he posted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> of himself diving into a lake, showcasing his swimming skills.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inaki Godoy has a net worth in the millions</h2><p>According to various sources, Inaki has an estimated net worth of $2.3 million, which he has accrued over nearly a decade through his acting skills.</p><p>The actor began his career at the age of four by enrolling in a theater musical school. Later in 2016, he made his professional acting debut in the Mexican television series La Querida del Centauro.</p><p>Since then, Inaki has been featured in several television series, including Sincronía in 2018, La Venganza de las Juanas in 2019, and Control Z in 2020.</p><p>Finally, in 2022, the actor secured a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">breakthrough role</a> when he was cast as Juan Ruiz in The Imperfects, a Netflix series centered around a group of teenagers with superpowers who must evade government pursuit.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The series achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success, with Inaki’s performance garnering accolades from critics and leaving a lasting impact.</p><p>After the resounding success of The Imperfects, the actor landed another prominent role as Monkey D. Luffy in the Netflix adaptation of the beloved manga series One Piece. The series was recently released on August 32, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that Inaki has become a part of such a colossal production, there’s a strong possibility that his net worth will see a rapid increase shortly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfnruit8hmnqicn656o7XOoKmaqJiuerGt0Z6lratf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middletons-best-hairstyles-2011147.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Middleton's All-Time Best Hairstyles">&larr;
