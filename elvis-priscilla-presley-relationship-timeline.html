So, if you're hoping to learn more about the pair's complicated romance, here is a complete timeline of their high-profile relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Elvis and Priscilla met at a party in 1959.</h2><p>In 1959, Elvis and Priscilla first crossed paths at a party in West Germany where both the musician (who served in the Army at the time) and Priscilla's stepfather, U.S. Air force officer Paul Beaulieu, were stationed.</p><p>Of course, most would assume there's no issue with two people meeting at a party and developing a connection. However, it's rather scandalous because, at the time, Elvis was 24 and Priscilla was only 14 years old.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although the two were smitten with one another, Priscilla's parents forbade her from ever seeing Elvis again.</p><p>Once Priscilla returned home late the night of the party, they weren't too fond of Elvis. Nevertheless, he eventually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">won over</a> his future in-laws. The pair continued to spend time together until the "Jailhouse Rock" singer left Germany in March 1960.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The pair stayed in touch, finally reuniting in 1962.</h2><p>Though they were on different continents, Elvis and Priscilla managed to stay in touch for two years. In 1962, Priscilla's parents finally allowed her to visit Elvis in Los Angeles on the condition that she be chaperoned and write to them every day.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>, Elvis ignored her parent's mandatory rules. Once Priscilla arrived, he took her to Las Vegas and "introduced her to drugs" so she could keep up with his lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 1963, Priscilla's parents let her move to Memphis to be with Elvis.</h2><p>By 1963, Priscilla's parents officially allowed her to move to Memphis to be with Elvis.</p><p>Yet again, her parents set some ground rules: Priscilla would attend an all-girls Catholic high school nearby, live with Elvis's parents in a separate home until she graduated, and Elvis would eventually marry Priscilla.</p><p>Again, Priscilla and Elvis didn't follow the agreement. She gradually moved in with the rockstar, making the Graceland mansion her permanent residence once Elvis promised her parents that he would marry Priscilla.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After settling in, Elvis headed to Hollywood for more films and left Priscilla in Memphis. Pop Sugar states that Elvis had various affairs with female co-stars, "which he shrugged off as just gossip."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Elvis and Priscilla were married on May 1, 1967.</h2><p>In late 1966, Elvis officially proposed to Priscilla. Several reports suggest he did so because Priscilla "threatened to talk to the press and her stepfather threatened to have Elvis charged with sexual crimes against a minor," per Pop Sugar.</p><p>On May 1, 1967, Elvis and Priscilla were married at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> reports there were very few guests in attendance, with a press conference and champagne breakfast to follow the private ceremony.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The newlyweds soon hopped on a private jet and enjoyed a brief honeymoon in Palm Springs before heading home to Memphis, where Priscilla quickly realized she was pregnant with their first child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The couple welcomed their first and only child, Lisa Marie, on Feb. 1, 1968.</h2><p>Just nine months after officially tying the knot, Elvis and Priscilla Presley welcomed their first and only child, <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a>, on Feb. 1, 1968. Regarding the morning of their daughter's birth, Priscilla said it was incredibly stressful.</p><p>In the book, Elvis by the Presleys: Intimate Stories From Priscilla Presley, Lisa Marie Presley, and Other Family Members, Priscilla revealed her water broke early, but it took Elvis a long time to get out of bed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Elvis is moving around the house in slow motion while I’m crossing my legs," Priscilla said via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic Country Music</a>. "He finally finds his cigars, but now he’s lulling around the kitchen, getting a bite to eat. Elvis is acting like we’ve all the time in the world."</p><p>The King of Rock and Roll then proceeded to drive to the wrong hospital, believing they were meant to check in at the Methodist Hospital. Luckily, everything turned out just fine and Priscilla gave birth in the afternoon.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Elvis and Priscilla divorced in 1973.</h2><p>Eventually, Elvis and Priscilla's marriage began to crumble.</p><p>Throughout their six-year marriage, Elvis continued to tour heavily and frequently cheated on Priscilla with several co-stars.
