"I think I pinch myself all the time thinking how lucky we are to be in this life together," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curious to learn more about their romance?

It's important for people to come out. Visibility is important," Rapinoe told ESPN The Magazine at the time. "I feel like [there are] a lot of negative ideas that hopefully I can break down just by being myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "Not only are we female athletes, but we're dating as well.
