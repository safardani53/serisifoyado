So to know that the photographer was there poised waiting is highly suspicious.”</p><p>Speaking about a “surprise” liaison with Ms Davy on his gap year in Argentina, he added: “All I can remember is within 24 hours of getting to the remote polo farm I was surprised Chelsy was there.</p><p>“My friend Mark Dyer had organised it. The farm itself, the ranch, within 24 hours was besieged by approximately 15 to 20 paparazzi and obviously Marko and Chelsy had planned the trip secretly together using their mobile phones.”</p><p>Harry spoke about his friendship with blonde <a href=#>Astrid Harbord</a> who was named in a story about a trip to the rugby, which he claims was obtained illegally.</p><p>He said: “We were never in a relationship. So the cavorting at Twickenham, I’m not sure what that was referencing.”</p><p>He said they were seen in public, adding: “But I wasn’t cavorting.”</p><p>The Duke clashed several times with the barrister.</p><p>At one stage, Mr Green told him: “This isn’t about you asking me questions, this is about me asking you questions.”</p><p>When Mr Green pointed out Harry and Ms Davy’s “trial separation” was already widely reported in the Sunday papers, moody Harry retorted: “I’ll take your word for it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2006-prince-mates-sipped-vodkas-823376886.jpg><p>When Harry said he believed his or Chelsy’s voicemails were hacked, Mr Green said: “We are in the land of total speculation.”</p><p>Harry also claimed a tracking device was fitted to Chelsy’s car.</p><p>Asked how he knew, Harry replied: “We found it.” He claimed it was put there by Mike Behr, a private investigator.</p><p>Harry was later asked if he would be either “disappointed” or “relieved” if the court ruled his phone was not hacked.</p><p>He replied: “To have a decision against me...yes I would feel some injustice if it wasn’t accepted.”</p><p>He was asked: “So you want to have been phone-hacked?”</p><p>Harry replied: “No one wants to have been phone hacked.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>After he was dismissed by Justice Fancourt, Harry puffed his cheeks and chose to sit at the back of Courtroom 15 to hear the grilling of ex-journalist Jane Kerr.</p><p>He had earlier repeatedly begged the court to quiz journalists on how they had obtained information that led to stories about his private life.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">‘I don't know’ 18 times in 3 hours</h3></p><p>By Joe Morgan</p><p><strong>PRINCE Harry said “I don’t know” 18 times during three hours in the witness box yesterday.</strong></p><p>Here are four more of the Duke’s claims which struggled to stand up to scrutiny...</p><p>HARRY said a 2006 story about his lap dance from a stripper came from “unlawful information gathering”, despite it coming from a freelancer — and the court heard the report did not add “anything of substance” to what had already appeared in other articles;</p><p>STORY about a knee injury in 2005 must have been from hacking, Harry said, but Clarence House put out details of the injury a year earlier;</p><p>THE Mail On Sunday was first to publish girlfriend Chelsy’s full name, but Harry claimed the Mirror used details which must have been from phone hacking.</p><p>When asked why he hadn’t sued other newspapers over the story, he said: “I have no reason. I’m busy with other litigation”;</p><p>DUKE called a paparazzi photo of him dropping Chelsy off after a night at Kensington Palace “suspicious”, but The Mirror said snappers were often outside the palace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ393fZNxbWlnoKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKuerTA0aKnZpucqq9ur86uqa1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zf48jvuhposxwmgtgihopxmke50gsknq.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV">&larr;
