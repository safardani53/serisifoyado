When mommy talks s**t about people, you cannot go tell them. Why would you tell auntie Kendall I hated her outfit?"</p><p>The scene then changed to Kendall, who filled in her sister <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, 26, on the awkward moment.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON THE KARDASHIANS">READ MORE ON THE KARDASHIANS</h2><p>In the confessional, Kendall said: "Kim was telling me, like all night, she's like 'No no no no no, it's great, it's great. Your look is great. I love it, I love it, I love it.'</p><p>"And then North and Penelope were in my room after and I go, 'Oh guys, who your favorite of the night?' Then they were like, 'You were actually our favorite.' And I was like, 'Oh my God, stop, really?' And they were like, 'Yeah, we really loved yours, you were our favorite.'</p><p>"And I was like, 'Your mom said she really liked my look, too.' And she [North] goes, 'She was lying, she told me she did not like your look.' I was taken aback. Whatever, but I was North's favorite, so that's all that matters I guess. And Penelope."</p><p>Pulling herself back together after gasping in shock, Kylie agreed: "Yeah, the kids always know."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"It's all about the kids, the cool, the hip kids," joked model Kendall.</p><p>The scene flipped back to Kim and North, with the young girl responding: "Because you didn't," suggesting that she saw no problem with telling the truth about her mom's feelings.</p><p>Kim countered: "But still. There's like a thing about honesty, and there's a thing about loyalty of like having your momma's back."</p><p>"Well you never told me to not tell. I always don't tell when you say to not tell," said a nonplussed North.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NORTH'S WRATH</h2><p>While Kendall's outfit was up for debate, <a href=#>North also shocked fans with her harsh words</a> about Kim's own Met Gala gown.</p><p>Giving feedback as <a href=#>Kim tried the dress on</a>, North said: "There's way too much gaps in the pearls. It looks like she's a Hawaiian girl with her dress all ripped."</p><p>The pre-teen also claimed that the pearls looked "fake," which prompted Kim to respond.</p><p>"No, no, I think you're wrong here," she corrected.</p><p>"These are very expensive, real pearls. I think you need a lesson on pearls. We're not going for flapper girl, we're going for vintage, authentic pearly girly."</p><p>North continued on to say that she thought the gown was too "beachy" and that the diamond&nbsp;accessories around the neck would "ruin" the outfit.</p><p>She told her mother: "I like the pearls. I just don't like that it looks, like, from the Dollar Store."</p><p>A shocked Kim reproached: "There's a way to be honest and not to hurt people's feelings. So I want you to learn that."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>IN THE SPOTLIGHT</h2><p>Alongside North, Kim shares&nbsp;<a href=#>Saint</a>, 7;&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago</a>, 5; and&nbsp;<a href=#>Psalm</a>, 4, with ex-husband&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West</a>, 46.</p><p>In&nbsp;the <a href=#>summer</a>, a fan took to&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;with a screenshot of Kim's <a href=#>Instagram</a> feed from her recent&nbsp;<a href=#>Tokyo</a>&nbsp;trip, and&nbsp;Kardashian&nbsp;critics noted how frequently North appeared in the posts, while the other kids remained absent.</p><p>Starting&nbsp;<a href=#>the discussion</a>, the fan wrote: "Does she not have other kids?"</p><p>In response, another&nbsp;<a href=#>Kardashian-Jenner</a>&nbsp;follower wrote: "She only acknowledges the kid who gives her&nbsp;<span id=73c50798-a1b0-490f-b45a-8c175d8de783 class=suggested-link>money</span>. Right now, only North. It is exactly how her mother did, so why expect any different?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Sadly, that means she will prompt her kids to fight for her love and will discard the ones who don't align with the brand."</p><p>"I wish North wasn't in her feed either. Using your kids as a prompt shouldn't be allowed. Exposing them on&nbsp;<span id=de5b6924-2ccd-45ad-8e9b-0202a45ee8be class=suggested-link>social media</span>&nbsp;is a burden they will wear for the rest of their lives," a third person lamented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/line-beauty-metropolitan-museum-art-850008269.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/kim-kardashian-north-west-seen-851518315-9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/kim-kardashian-rips-north-west-861963760.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZ2Z%2FdXyXaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYruwvtOhZLCdo6l6o7HTq5iyoZ6ceq272JqjrbFdqLKkvsStZKSdnpmurbiO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./logal-paul-scammed-fake-pokemon-cards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Logan Paul scammed into spending $3.5million on FAKE Pokemon Cards as boxer was duped into buying ol">&larr;
