He was taken into care, but had a tough upbringing.</p><p>Aged eight he was sent to St. Leonard’s Children’s Home in Hornchurch, Essex, where he says he endured physical and emotional abuse.</p><p>Paul, whose early life inspired last year’s hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> film Big Boys Don't Cry, starring <a href=#>This Is England</a> actor Michael Socha, says: “I used to hide under my bed with a knife for protection.”</p><p>On his birth certificate, Matthew and Mary Connolly, who were Irish immigrants, are listed as Paul's parents.</p><p>Paul, who was later able to access his social services file, says: “They moved to the East End to try to make ends meet. Stepney Green was an absolute slum in the late 60s.”</p><p>He only saw his mum a handful of times growing up, and had limited contact with his seven siblings, who Paul says all went into care at some point &nbsp;- although they were in different homes to him. &nbsp;</p><p>But he recalls being aware that he looked different to his brother, who was “fair and ginger”.</p><p>He says: “My older brother used to say to me, ‘You’re Pino’s son.’ It was said a few times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/neighbour-heard-cries-called-social-828049892.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/neighbour-heard-cries-called-social-828049718.jpg><p>Pino was a local <a href=#>Maltese </a>businessman who ran a shop close to where his&nbsp;family&nbsp;lived.</p><p>Paul says: “He was an entrepreneur. He had a cafe, a newsagent and he owned property. I believe he hung around with <a href=#>the Krays</a>.”</p><p>He'd always thought his brother was joking and thought little more about it.</p><p>But decades later, his sons Harley, 19, and 14-year-old Archie bought him a DNA test sampling kit as a Christmas present in 2021.</p><p>He says: “I’ve always said to my sons, ‘you know, you’re all Irish’.”</p><p>But he was stunned to discover the results revealed he was half Irish, half Maltese.</p><p>He says: “The first name that popped into my head was Pino.”</p><p>My older brother used to say to me, ‘You’re Pino’s son.’ It was said a few times</p><span class=quote-credit>Paul Connolly</span><p>Paul knew the chances of finding his birth father were slim. He says: “I’m 61 this year so I knew he might well not be alive.”</p><p>After widening the DNA analysis,&nbsp;Long&nbsp;Lost&nbsp;Family’s specialist researchers discovered Paul had a half brother and were able to track him down.</p><p>During the show dad-of-two Frankie, who runs an IT business and is a semi-professional singer songwriter, tells presenter <a href=#>Nicky Campbell</a> his dad was a Maltese shop owner called Philip Psaila, also known as Pino.</p><p>Frankie grew up with his mum and Pino would visit occasionally before he died in 1968.</p><p>When Frankie’s mum fell ill he was fostered, and at one point lived in Hornchurch, Essex, just like Paul.</p><p>Shockingly they both attended Bishop Ward, an all-boys Catholic school in Dagenham, Essex, now called All Saints Catholic School.</p><p>Paul says: “We went to the same school at the same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/neighbour-heard-cries-called-social-828049913.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/neighbour-heard-cries-called-social-828049653.jpg><p>“He’s a couple of years older than me so we weren’t in the same class, but we would have walked the same corridors.”</p><p>In another coincidence, their paths crossed again when they were older.</p><p>Paul explains: “Frankie actually said to me, ‘You look familiar’. He is a musician and it turned out he used to go to the same nightclub where I worked as head door man.</p><p>“No doubt I would have searched him on the way in.”</p><p>Frankie’s mum died in 2017, while Paul’s mum passed away a few years ago.</p><p>Reflecting on the reasons why his mum abandoned him, Paul says: “My mum must have known I would look different to the rest of the kids.</p><p>"I think she was embarrassed that I was illegitimate. In the 60s, that was a big deal.</p><p>Mum had a tough upbringing and she had to do what she had to do to survive.

It was probably the best thing she could have done really.”</p><p>He adds: “I probably only had about three or four conversations with my mum. She could have told me at any time but she chose to die with that.”</p><p>The half brothers have been enjoying getting to know each other since their first meeting at an Essex pub last October.</p><p>Paul says: “Frankie loves to send me a WhatsApp voice note. He’s been away and has been sending me pictures of his travels. We’re due to have lunch soon.”</p><p>He has also been in contact with Frankie’s daughters, Gemma, 40, and Katie, 38, and hopes one day to meet them and his granddaughters, Ellie, 14, and four-year-old Ayla.</p><p>Paul says: “My partner Rebecca has met Frankie and gets on with him.
