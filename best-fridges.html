This is above the recommended temperatures for storing food but it’s a great option if you’re going on holiday for a bit and only need the freezer on.</p><p>Two things in particular stood out for us.</p><p>First, it’s incredibly quiet, with a noise level of just 36 dB - that’s quiet enough to sleep next to.</p><p>Second, the fridge section has several dedicated compartments that are capable of achieving different temperatures and even varying humidity levels.</p><p>And according to Siemens, this is meant to ensure your food lasts for longer. Certainly, the vegetables we kept in the dedicated drawer seemed to last for ages.</p><p>We think that while this fridge freezer costs a fair bit at the moment, it’s pretty good value for money, especially in the long run as you’ll save a lot in energy costs.</p><h2>Kenwood KUL55X18 undercounter fridge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/l_10175325_003.jpg><ul><li><strong>Kenwood KUL55X18 undercounter fridge, £189.99 from Currys -

These often have the added bonus of ice and water dispensers built into the fridge.</p><p>When it comes to deciding which fridge to buy, size is critical. It’s obvious, but make sure your model is going to fit your space (most are 60cm in width), and remember that a lot of freestanding models will need a few centimetres of room at the back to breathe, so you won’t be able to butt it up flat against the wall.</p><p>A built-in model is ideal if you want your kitchen - and appliances - to look seamless, but bear in mind that you won’t then be able to take your fridge with you if you move.</p><p>Smart fridges - that allow you to control the fridge from wherever you are on your phone - are also gaining traction, from brands like Hotpoint, Samsung and LG.</p><p>Compartments are crucial, too: you’ll want to make sure there’s enough of the right storage for your needs.</p><p>For example, if you eat fresh a lot, make sure you’ve got plenty of temp-controlled drawers for keeping veg and salad crisp. Families are often keen for fridge-freezer combos with plenty of compartments that allow them to batch-cook meals and then freeze them for later.</p><p>Some fridges are also more energy-efficient than others - choosing one with a better rating can save you money down the line.</p><p>Don't forget about style: from colour to silhouette, a fridge is an item you'll be looking at, and using, multiple times a day. Make sure you like the look of it.</p><h2>How much does a fridge cost to buy?</h2><p>You'll find fridges for under a couple of hundred pounds.</p><p>For those on a budget, look out for fridges from name-brands that are sub-£450 - Samsung has a couple of models in this category that get the job done effectively, as do Beko, Kenwood and Russell Hobbs.<br>If you can stretch to the £700 range, there are some fantastic fridge-freezer options available.</p><p>Those coveting a ginormous American-style fridge freezer will typically be looking at spending around £1k or more, while some smart fridges, with all of the bells and whistles, cost over £2k.</p><h2>Can you get a fridge without a freezer?</h2><p>Fridges without freezers are cheaper to buy and run. Known as larder fridges, these can be built-in or freestanding.</p><p>You'll find well-rated larder fridges from brands including Miele, Bosch, Russell Hobbs and AEG.</p><h2>What are the best fridge brands,?</h2><p>When it comes to finding the best fridge, a few different brands - at different price points - score consistently well when it comes to reliability.</p><p>Samsung and LG are pricey - but fantastic and reliable, especially if you're looking for a fridge with all the trimmings.</p><p>Beko scores consistently well in the budget category.</p><h2>What temperature should a fridge be?</h2><p>According to the UK food standards agency, the ideal fridge temperature for food is below 8°C - but, to take into account the fridge door opening and closing and the temperature changing because of this, the temperature should be set for between 1-5°C.</p><p>It takes about 24 hours for your fridge to adjust to any changes you make temperature-wise.</p><h2><b>How does a fridge work?</b></h2><p>A fridge is made up of a selection of different components.</p><p>Typically there are five basic components: fluid refrigerant; a compressor, the condenser coils, the evaporator coils and an expansion device - all of these components interact in a cycle to keep your food cool.</p><p>The first part of the refrigeration cycle involves the compressor constricting refrigerant vapour and pushing it into the coils on the outside of the refrigerator.</p><p>When the hot gas in the coils meets a cooler air temperature it becomes a liquid.</p><p>In liquid form at high pressure, the refrigerant then cools down as it flows into the coils inside the fridge.</p><p>Then, the refrigerant absorbs the heat inside the fridge, cooling down the air, before evaporating to a gas and flowing back to the compressor (where the cycle starts all over).</p><h2>How to clean a fridge</h2><p>It’s important to keep your fridge clean - after all, you will be eating the food stored inside it.</p><p>How thorough your clean is will depend on how often you do so - generally speaking it’s a good idea to wipe down your fridge shelves once a week and have deep clean once every few months.</p><p>For a quick clean, first empty your fridge shelves. Multipurpose disinfectant wipes are great for the job as you can easily wipe down your shelves, killing any germs, and get your food back in the fridge in a jiffy.</p><p>For a deeper clean, it’s best to start from the top down and to do so before going food shopping, so you have less to contend with and can save any food from becoming contaminated if it warms up.</p><p>Pull out the shelves and drawers and soak them in warm water and dish-washing soap. Make sure you clean any shelf grooves and hard to reach nooks and crannies before putting everything back in.</p><p>You can also wipe down the outside of your fridge for a perfect finish.</p><h2>What number should my fridge be on?</h2><p>If the numbers on your fridge settings confuse you - don’t worry. The higher the number, the cooler your fridge will be.</p><p>The number you select should be decided using a couple of different factors. If your fridge is pretty full of food you need the colder settings, numbers three to four.</p><p>If your fridge is on the emptier side, you can choose between numbers two and three.</p><p>When it comes to temperature inside your fridge, it also matters on which shelf the food is stored. In older fridges, the higher you go, generally, the colder it gets - but the opposite is true for newer fridges so do check the manual.</p><h2>How long do fridges last?</h2><p>Fridges can last for years, but the lifespan of a fridge depends on the quality of your fridge and how well you’ve looked after it.</p><p>Generally speaking, your fridge should last at least 10 years - with many being able to last far longer, up to around the 20 year mark.</p><p>Regular maintenance can help to extend your fridge's lifespan and if you notice your fridge is having problems staying cool or if it starts to frost up you should have it serviced.</p><h2>How to dispose of a fridge</h2><p>You should be very careful when disposing of your old appliance.</p><p>Generally, you can arrange a special collection via your council for a fee - you can find out more and apply for this at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.gov.uk/collection-large-waste-items</a>,</p><p>You could also dispose of your old fridge at a designated hazardous waste recycling site - this generally doesn’t cost anything. It is important to check, though, that the site is able to dispose of fridges as not all waste recycling sites do offer this.</p><p>You should never just dump your fridge - some components of fridges are harmful to the environment and, if you don’t properly dispose of your fridge, you could be prosecuted and fined up to £2,500.</p><h2>Where to buy a fridge</h2><p>You can buy a fridge at many online retailers.</p><p>Remember, it’s always worth comparing deals and offers to make sure you’re getting the best price you can for your chosen fridge.</p><h2>How much are fridges?</h2><p>Fridges can range in price and you can usually hunt down one to fit your budget.</p><p>In our guide above, we found that prices for the best fridges ranged from anywhere from around £149 to £2,000.</p><h2>Can you put hot food in the fridge?</h2><p>You should let your food cool down before you put it in the fridge.</p><p>As a general rule, food should be at room temperature before it is placed in the fridge.</p><p>Placing hot food in the fridge can raise the fridge temperature, making it work harder to bring it down again. This temperature change could also affect the other food inside the fridge - possibly causing bacteria to multiply.</p><h2>Should eggs be kept in the fridge?</h2><p>Generally, it is best to store eggs in the fridge - but the egg racks commonly found on the fridge door may not be the best spot.</p><p>These egg racks are susceptible to changes in temperature, every time the fridge door opens and closes - so try and keep them on a shelf instead.</p><h2>How long does cooked chicken last in the fridge?</h2><p>Generally, cooked chicken can last for approximately three to four days when kept in the fridge.</p><p>Make sure that your cooked chicken is properly covered and air-tight, whilst being refrigerated.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HOME</h2></p><p>Enjoyed this roundup of the best fridges?
