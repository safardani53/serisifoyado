Sophie Turner, 27, before they dined at New York eatery Emilio’s Ballato with actress Blake Lively and Blake’s older sister Robyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

joined by Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs NFL player Patrick Mahomes, teammate to Taylor’s rumoured new squeeze Travis Kelce.</p><p>Since Sophie’s messy split from Jonas Brothers pop star Joe Jonas, 34, last month, the Better Than Revenge singer has swooped in to provide support, a few girls’ nights out, a listening ear and even a temporary home for Brit Sophie and her young children.</p><p>Here, we look at all the times Taylor has proved to be the ultimate female friend.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Sophie Turner</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Taylor offers actress space in her New York apartment amid bitter custody row</strong></p><p>ANOTHER ex of US pop star Joe Jonas, Taylor has <a href=#>moved Sophie into her New York apartment</a>, ­providing a US sanctuary where the British actress can stay with her young daughters during a vicious tug of love battle with her estranged husband.</p><p>Game Of Thrones star <a href=#>Sophie</a> claimed she only heard about Joe filing for divorce through the media and launched her own lawsuit suing him for ­“wrongful retention” of their two children in New York and accusing him of withholding their passports so she could not travel with them back to the UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SPL9928594_008_Taylor-Swift-Dines-At-Via-Conde-With-Sophie-Turner-In-NYCjpg-JS846344132.jpg> <img

increasingly acrimonious split, which also saw Sophie file a separate case for custody in the UK, Taylor publicly nailed her colours to her pal’s mast.</p><p>The singer, who dated Joe when she was 18 and later called him out for dumping her in a “25-second call”, was seen linking arms with Sophie on two nights out in a week.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The pair partied until 2am in <a href=#>New York</a> after a low-key dinner then met up with a group of pals two days later at a luxury hotel before moving on to martinis and caviar at a trendy bar.</p><p>“Taylor is a great friend,” a source told people.com. “Sophie can talk to her about anything.”</p><p>A New York court ruled Sophie’s daughters Willa, three, and one-year-old Delphine had to stay in the US until custody arrangements were settled and last week Sophie was seen packing her girls into an SUV outside Taylor’s property to go back to Joe.</p><p>Sophie and Taylor were friends before the bitter split.</p><p>They first bonded when they appeared on <a href=#>The Graham Norton Show</a> in 2019, but the friendship has moved on to a new level.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Kristen Stewart</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Taylor stepped up as shoulder to cry on after split with co-star Robert Pattinson</strong></p><p>THE brooding queen of vampire movies may seem an unlikely fit for the upbeat pop princess, but Taylor reached out during <a href=#>Kristen’s</a> heartbreaking split from co-star Robert Pattinson.</p><p>Taylor was such a huge fan of the Twilight movies she campaigned for a role in the series and met ­Kristen through co-star Taylor Lautner, who the singer briefly dated in 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CP_BEST_LIPS_07jpg-JS287589142.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/156043020HG00133_The_Twilig-JS702495193.jpg><p>In 2013, Kristen went through a very public split from British actor Robert, her boyfriend of four years, after cheating on him with Snow White And The Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.</p><p>After packing her bags to move out of their <a href=#>LA</a> apartment, she was snapped in a car heading to Taylor’s Beverley Hills home, where she stayed the night.</p><p>“Kristen went over with some friends,” said a source. “They have some friends in common and hung out.”</p><p>While neither has ever publicly mentioned their friendship, it’s safe to assume Taylor invited Kristen over to help ease the pain of her messy break-up.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Cara Delevingne</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Enjoyed nights out after break-ups at same time</strong></p><p>CARA joined Taylor’s crew after the pair met at a 2013 Victoria’s Secret show where the singer performed.</p><p>The model was one of the famous Swiftie “Girl Squad” who appeared in the star-studded 2014 Bad Blood video, along with other pals including <a href=#>Lena Dunham</a>, Gigi Hadid and Selena Gomez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Clark) after an 18-month romance, reportedly due to the British model’s partying lifestyle.</p><p>Taylor, who had just suffered her own break-up with actor <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a> after a three-month whirlwind romance, rallied round to get the squad back together and support devastated pal Cara with nights out on the town.</p><p>While comforting each other through their respective splits, the glam pair enjoyed a series of evenings in New York with the likes of Dakota Johnson, Suki Waterhouse, Lily Donaldson, Lorde and Martha Hunt.</p><p>The whole group were also spotted at a private Kings Of Leon gig with model Lily Aldridge, who is married to the band’s lead singer Caleb Followill.</p><p>The two women have remained fiercely loyal to each other, with Cara slamming <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> when he defended Scooter Braun’s controversial takeover of Taylor’s back catalogue in 2019, and calling her “brilliant” when she announced she was re-recording her old albums to take back control.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Gigi Hadid</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Taylor played matchmaker for heartbroken model</strong></p><p>GIRL Squad member <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> had the benefit of Taylor’s tear-strewn shoulder during a brief split from Zayn Malik in 2016.</p><p>“Gigi and Taylor are actually confiding in each other as best friends during this time,” a source told E! at the time. “They can really relate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ad-GettyImages-1170406671jpg-JS625453878.jpg> <img

model later reunited with the former One Direction star and went on to have daughter Khai, now three, but the couple split for good in 2021 after an alleged altercation between <a href=#>Zayn</a> and Gigi’s mum Yolanda.</p><p>Taylor and her then actor partner <a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a> turned matchmaker in the wake of the messy break-up, setting her pal up with possible dates.</p><p>“The girls are very close and it breaks Taylor’s heart to see how badly things have turned out for Gigi,” a source told OK! mag.</p><p>“Gigi has seemed so lost. Taylor hates seeing her this way.</p><p>“She feels the best remedy is for Gigi to have fun and get some attention from the guys.</p><p>“Taylor is putting feelers out among all her and Joe’s friends, and there’s no doubt she’ll have Gigi fixed up and smiling soon.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Selena Gomez</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Taylor was ‘huge help’ when she split from Nick Jonas and Justin Bieber</strong></p><p>THE two singers met when they were both briefly ­dating members of the Jonas Brothers in 2008, with ­<a href=#>Selena</a> dating Nick while Taylor was with sibling Joe.</p><p>Even though they were still in their teens, Selena says Taylor, who is two years her senior, was a ­massive help in helping her get over their break-up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/trp__33_jpg-JS845583121.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Was4426416-JS764092681.jpg><p>“Every single problem I ever have is healable by Taylor Swift,” she said in 2009.</p><p>“If I ever have an issue, Taylor has gone through it, because she’s older than me, and she gives the most thought-out answers.</p><p>“And what I love about Taylor is that she does believe in the whole love story, Prince Charming and soul mates.</p><p>“Because of her, I haven’t lost faith. We literally talk every day.”</p><p>Selena revealed they make each other playlists when going through hard times, adding: “I send her some girl-empowering music and she sends some back.”</p><p>Selena, 31, would face even greater heartache when her five-year, on-off romance with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> ended in 2014 – but once again, Taylor was there to help.</p><p>And in the ultimate girl pal act of generosity, the queen of break-up songs even offered to help Selena pen her own diss track about the Canadian pop star.</p><p>“She obviously has her own technique for it that works so well with her, and she just knows how to make hits,” Selena said.</p><p>“I like to keep things a little more internal, and she’s given me great advice on how to do that.”</p><p>Selena went on to shower praise on her BFF adding: “I think she’s one of the strongest girls I’ve ever met, to be honest. She’s really strong and very passionate. I love that.”</p><p>In 2018, Selena made a guest appearance on ­Taylor’s Reputations tour, giving a heartfelt speech on stage about her pal.</p><p>“The reason she has been one of my best friends is because this person has never judged a single decision I’ve made. She’s always met me where I’ve been.</p><p>“She’s encouraged me, and I don’t know if I would be as strong as I am if I didn’t have you and your ­fa­mily because you’ve changed my life.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Suki Waterhouse</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Brit model joined singer’s squad after break-up with film star Bradley Cooper</strong></p><p>TAYLOR bonded with <a href=#>Suki</a> in the wake of the model’s split from actor Bradley Cooper in 2015 and she quickly became part of the singer-songwriter’s team of close pals.</p><p>The model, 31, was among the friends who partied at a private gig in 2016, and Taylor was her confidante as Suki went on to navigate the dating scene and a brief romance with actor Diego Luna.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GYI1692357932jpg-JS846606525.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/d2e2c05e-0d42-49a9-a0ee-d31f5a2ce41c.jpg><p>The British beauty is now in a long-term relationship with actor Robert Pattinson, which began in 2018, and the couple shared regular double dates with Taylor and ex Joe Alwyn before their shock split in April this year.</p><p>Suki has previously revealed Taylor helped her over break-ups: “<a href=#>Taylor</a> is a friend of mine. She’s amazing.</p><p>“I feel as though when she likes something or supports someone, she is always really true to that.”</p><p>Suki continued: “I’m a real Swiftie.”</p><p>Taylor recently repaid the compliment, saying: “When we hang out, I often come away wondering how someone can be simultaneously spontaneous and free – and also preternaturally wise.</p><p>“She is the wildest person I know who, at the same time, I would trust to keep any secret.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She added: “You’ll be stressed about something trivial and she’ll just look at you, cigarette in hand, and say, ‘Babe, you know none of this actually matters’.</p><p>“And she’ll be exactly right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYmeCeYWQaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjqr2xu9GtZKyskafAbrTOpaOyr5%2BksW6u0Z6YpGWlpXq0u8%2BhoJ5lpKq%2Fr7HRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chelsea-handler-im-going-to-stop-making-fun-of-tori-spelling-200996.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chelsea Handler: &amp;quot;I'm Going to Stop Making Fun of Tori Spelling&amp;quot;">&larr;
