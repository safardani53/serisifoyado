We put the most recent weight, even if it may have changed. His hair is light brown, while his eyes are dark brown.</p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li class=ql-align-justify>Taylor has represented a number of franchises in different countries throughout his career. He has represented Royal Challengers Bangalore, Pune Warriors India, Delhi Daredevils, and Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.</li><li class=ql-align-justify>He played for the Victorian Bushrangers in the 2009-10 KFC T20 Big Bash. In the 2009-10 HRV Cup Final, he scored 80 off 30 balls as his side Central Stags went on to win the tournament.</li><li>Ross Taylor has to be one of the unsung heroes of international cricket this decade. The guy has nearly 6000 Test and ODI runs at an average of 48 and 45, respectively.</li><li>However, when discussing the best batsman in global cricket, Taylor’s name is hardly mentioned. It’s an irony for his image, given how he surged into international cricket with a carefree style of strokeplay that wowed the audience.</li><li>After making his debut on the domestic circuit during the 2002-03 season, he gradually established himself as a solid batsman for Central Districts across all forms. The 2005-06 season launched his career, with a national call-up in early 2006 for home ODIs against Sri Lanka.</li><li>He made an instant impact, whacking his first century in the series to set the tone for the rest of his career. Later in the year, he made a couple more important contributions, ensuring that he would soon be handed the Test cap. It arrived, though, during a difficult tour of South Africa in 2007, and it was a baptism of fire for the youthful Taylor.</li><li>However, he rediscovered his stride during the home summer against England, belting out his first Test ton and three fifties. Taylor’s credentials in the longest format were further confirmed in the return series in England.</li><li>Scoring runs at Manchester is always a challenge for any batter, and he delivered with a masterclass performance of 154 following an impressive 74 at Lord’s. Despite his unconventional approach, Taylor’s fast hands and fierce resolve allowed him to adapt to any circumstance or assault.</li><li>From the 2011-12 season forward, he was remarkably consistent throughout formats, particularly in Tests. Since then, he has been a critical element in the Kiwi batting line-up, virtually often serving as the side’s crisis man against difficult opponents.</li><li>Taylor’s performance seemed to suffer in 2016, but an eye procedure followed and he returned with a bang. Despite being a decent batter in T20 leagues throughout the world, he hasn’t quite struck the same chord with New Zealand in the shortest format.</li><li>After the 2016 World T20, he seemed to be out of T20I contention, but the home series against Pakistan in January 2018 saw him make a return, albeit as a substitute, and perform a fantastic job.</li><li>Taylor is a true matchwinner who can destroy any assault, whether it fast or spin, when he is on form. He may have some mechanical flaws, but his hand-eye synchronization and unconventional strokes more than compensate.</li><li>The 2019 World Cup might be his last tournament, and he will undoubtedly be an important part if the Kiwis are to win the championship.</li><li>Ross Taylor is the most experienced player in New Zealand’s World Cup 2019 team, having played in World Cups in 2007, 2011, and 2015. Taylor was removed for a duck against England in his maiden World Cup debut in 2007, and he had a relatively poor score throughout the competition that season.</li><li>His sole World Cup century came against Pakistan in 2011, and it remains his only World Cup century to this day. Ross had a good World Cup 2011 where he constantly excelled, but he struggled in the first few games again in 2015.</li><li>Taylor returned to the running during the latter stages of the 2015 World Cup. Taylor chipped in with useful contributions of 56, 42, 30, and 40 against Bangladesh, West Indies, South Africa, and Australia, respectively, but his failure to convert these beginnings into large scores was a worry.</li><li>Taylor is the most seasoned batter in the team for World Cup 2019, therefore it’s past time he begins producing consistently and helps New Zealand reach the knockout stages. The 2019 World Cup might be his last tournament, so the middle-order batsman will want to make it count.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ross-Taylor-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Records</h2><ul><li class=ql-align-justify>Ross Taylor is the first New Zealander to have centuries against all Test playing nations in ODIs and the sixth overall.</li><li class=ql-align-justify>He is only the fourth batsman in the history of the game to have scored a century on his birthday.</li><li class=ql-align-justify>Ross also holds the record for scoring the most number of centuries in Tests for New Zealand jointly with Martin Crowe and Kane Williamson.</li></ul><h2>Ross Taylor’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Ross Taylor’s</strong> primary source of income is cricket. Taylor has an estimated net worth of USD $13 million in December 2023. He is a clean striker of the ball, particularly any ball through the leg side, and a useful off-break bowler. Taylor hit his first one-day century in front of a raucous crowd in Napier on December 28, 2006, against Sri Lanka. There were 12 fours and six sixes in the innings.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ross-Taylor-3-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Ross Taylor Wife, Marriage, Children</h2><p><strong>Victoria Taylor</strong> is a very private individual.

This assisted him in mastering the slow sweep shot. Because of hockey, he was an exceptional leg side cricketer.</li><li>He became the second male player Murphy Su’a of Samoan origin to play for The New Zealand Cricket team after being picked.</li><li>Taylor suffered from dehydration after scoring his first ODI century against Sri Lanka in December 2006, a match that New Zealand regretfully lost. He needed a brief visit to the hospital to be treated.</li><li>Taylor led New Zealand in the One Day format for the first time in 2010, after Daniel Vettori was forced to withdraw from the match against Australia. His $NZ 500 Man of the Match award was presented to the Lansdowne Cricket Club in Masterton.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqKujYsGixcuoqWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./noureen-dewulf-ryan-miller-welcome-son-bodhi-ryan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Miller and Noureen DeWulf Welcome Son Bodhi Ryan">&larr;
