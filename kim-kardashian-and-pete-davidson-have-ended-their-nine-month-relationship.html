According to sources close to the couple, the couple has opted to be friends while going on with their lives.&nbsp;According to sources, the couple split due to the difficulties of their “far distance dynamic” and “demanding schedules,” which made it “very tough to sustain a relationship,” but they still have “a lot of love and respect for each other.” According to reports, Davidson is now shooting his new feature Wizards! in Australia, while Kardashian is focused on raising her four children. Another insider informed the tabloid that the reality star’s divorce from Kanye West is “going along” and that the former couple are “happy co-parenting.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS: Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Have Broken Up After 9 Months <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FUobFHZ0gt</a></p><p>— Kelly Keegs (@kellykeegs) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2022</a></p><h2>Inside Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian’s relationship and Break Up</h2><p>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson shook the entertainment business last October when they appeared in an SNL comedy as Aladdin and Jasmine. Shortly later, the pair fueled dating rumors, and a source confirmed the news to E! News:</p><p>“Pete has informed her that he does not want to see anybody else.” She tells some people that they aren’t serious, but she isn’t seeing anybody else… She’s trying not to make a big deal out of it, but she’s madly in love with him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pete-Davidson-2.jpg alt="Pete Davidson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The couple’s high-profile affair started when they were caught together at Knott’s Scary Farm in California with Kourtney and her then-fiance Travis Barker. The couple will also pay a visit to Davidson’s hometown of Staten Island in November 2021.&nbsp;The couple continued to be seen together in public over the following several months, even attending high-profile events like the White House Correspondents Dinner and the Met Gala.</p><p>The former SNL presenter began connecting with Kardashian’s children and even got a “My daughter is a lawyer” tattoo in honor of the SKIMS founder. Davidson was also embroiled in a social media spat with Kim Kardashian’s ex-husband Kanye West, who proceeded to mock the former for many months.&nbsp;Kardashian made her relationship with Davidson on an Instagram official in March 2022, and she also discussed it on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast in April. When asked about their origins, she stated:</p><p>“It was a stage kiss, but it still had a little zing to it.” It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. ‘Hmm, there’s some BDE activity,’ I thought a few days later.”</p><p>Davidson was the only person that missed her SNL after-party before she decided to contact the host, according to the KUWTK alum:</p><p>“I considered it afterwards. “I was thinking, ‘Damn, he’s the only one who didn’t show up.'”</p><p>Davidson also appeared in the Hulu program The Kardashians and is slated to return for the second season. While Davidson was in Australia filming for his project, a source informed E! News that the pair were still attempting to make their relationship work:</p><p>“Even when they are apart, they are always communicating. Kim like the fact that he is always making her laugh and that he actually brightens her day when they chat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pete-Davidson-2.jpg><p>Meanwhile, on Hart to Hart last month, Davidson expressed his desire to settle down and have children in the future:</p><p>“That’s sort of what I’m really prepping for right now, is trying to be as good as a man and grow and improve so it when that occurs, it’s just easy.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson called it quits this week due to their respective busy schedules and the difficulties of a long-distance relationship. However, sources stated that “there was no drama” and that the couple divorced amicably.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKur7CMqZytnV2Zrre1w6ymp2WYlsOmecSnm56cXam1prXRZqWippViurC606Fkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mark-melancon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Melancon">&larr;
