made up of five houses - up for rent, where he’s lived for the last 28 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/ksl22039329-JS766194536.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/msemail_LB_BRAD_GRANNY_FLAT_06_copyjpeg-JS766194421.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/o-brad-angie-kids-570jpg-js268432136jpg-JS268432845.jpg><p>In July, <a href=#>Pitt</a> spent $40million on American author D.L James' former home, known as “Seaward,” in Carmel, a luxury coastal town in <a href=#>California</a>.</p><p>Carmel-by-the-Sea is a favorite for aging stars like the late Doris Day, Joan Fontaine, and <a href=#>Betty White</a>. <a href=#>Clint Eastwood</a> also calls it home.</p><p>Moving also makes life a lot more difficult for Pitt to see his six children while living a five-hour drive up the west coast.</p><p>The surprise move by Pitt, who used to share the compound with Jolie and the kids while they were together, has been discovered through a publicly-available mortgage agreement.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about celebrities">Read more about celebrities</h2><p>His management has completed the agreement with the Canadian bank, City National Bank (CNB), nicknamed the "bank of the stars.”</p><p>In June, Pitt’s long-time manager, Cynthia Pett-Dante, signed a "deed of trust and assignment of rents" with CNB.</p><p>The “assignment of rents”, is a special type of mortgage solely for rental properties, allowing the bank to collect the rent directly from a tenant if Pitt fails to keep up with the loan repayments.</p><p>As part of the deal, Pitt has also agreed to a $17.5million line of credit with CNB - called a "Home Equity Line of Credit Agreement."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>This means he’s allowed to borrow any amount from the bank up to that agreed figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Realtor Billy Rose is a former real estate attorney and celebrity agent, who's co-founder of The Agency, which buys and sells high-end property across the globe.</p><p>Rose explains that such a line of credit isn’t uncommon for the rich and famous, especially if it’s secured at a low-interest rate.</p><p>This is because it can be used to purchase assets or property, which will rise in value at a higher rate than the interest charged.</p><p>It’s unknown if Pitt funded the Carmel purchase with this line of credit.</p><p>He says: "You have an asset, which you use as security for a loan, and during the days of two or one percent [interest], then you have a line of credit where they’re not really charging you anything in interest.</p><p>"For some people, it’s a way of making money - I can take out the money that I’m paying one percent on, then I can use it to buy something, an asset or property."</p><p>Forbes valued Pitt’s net worth at around $300million, but it doesn’t always mean a celebrity has tens of millions in readily available cash, Rose said.&nbsp;</p><p>Rose, who’s not connected to the Pitt deal, added: "Banks take pretty high risks, they’re going to appraise your house and give you a percentage of its value.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of wealth is tied up, but it's maybe where they [a famous person] think: 'I want a line, I’m going to take it, if I should ever want it or need it.’"</p><p>Like most celebrities, Pitt has bought his properties through trusts.&nbsp;</p><p>His Los Feliz compound is owned by The Briarcliff Trust and Pett-Dante is the trustee.</p><p>Pitt began building his compound in July 1994 when he purchased a six-bedroom, Craftsman-style house for $1.7million.</p><p>Two years later, he purchased a small house for $380,000 at the back of his land and, in 1998, acquired another neighboring house for $475,000.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was with Jolie, Pitt bought another small property in 2008 for nearly $1.3million.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, he purchased a huge barn structure with a secret cave and its own bar for $1.1 million in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, Pitt and Jolie installed a skatepark by the side of their main villa, which now wraps around one side.</p><p>There are three pools and Pitt also purchased land across the road for a tennis court. &nbsp;</p><p>Pitt, who has always taken an interest in architecture, wanted to create a free-flowing compound, which was in keeping with the original houses in the area, dating back to 1915.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>His friend, director Andrew Dominik, says: "You go to the homes of most movie stars and they're like really, really nice hotel rooms. Brad lives in pieces of art.</p><p>"There's a breeze blowing through every window. As soon as you walk through the door, you feel stoned."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/BRAD_GRANNY_FLAT_05-copy-3.jpeg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY22GeX2WaJmrmZRivarA02apnqakqHqwwdNmo6irXZa7qLHLnqpmm5%2BivbDBzZ1m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-dances-hot-pink-catsuit-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Dances In Hot Pink Catsuit In New Video  Watch  Hollywood Life">&larr;
