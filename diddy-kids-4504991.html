The superstar performer is going to be honored at the<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> 2023 MTV Video Music Awards</a> on September 12 with the Global Icon Award and he’ll also perform at the show. In addition to his many talents, Diddy also goes by many&nbsp;names. As fans know, the rapper and record producer was born Sean Combs, but over the years has been known by monikers such as Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy, Love, and Diddy. But to his children, he’s merely known as “Dad.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Diddy (that’s how he’ll go by in this story, at least) has seven children, one of whom is adopted. The “I Need a Girl” singer welcomed his kids from four different relationships, including his on-again, off-again romance with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Porter</strong></a>, who sadly died in 2018. On December 10, 2022 he also shocked the world with the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announcement of baby number seven</a>: <strong>Love Sean Combs</strong>. “I’m so blessed to welcome my baby girl Love Sean Combs to the world.

Like her siblings, Chance has taken up modeling, and even recently appeared in the September 2021 issue of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;with her father and twin sisters. Chance seems to have a very close bond with her sisters, as the three girls are constantly documenting their outings together on their social media pages. She’s also close with mom Sarah, as proven in Chance’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mother’s Day tribute</a>&nbsp;she shared to her parent back in May 2021.</p><h2>D’Lila & Jessie Combs<i></i></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/diddys-kids-DLila-Jessie-Combs-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Diddy and Kim’s youngest children, 16-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>twins</a> <strong>D’Lila Star </strong>and <strong>Jessie James Combs</strong>, were born in December 2006. Their mother sadly died when they were only 11 years old, and since then they’ve been raised by Diddy alongside their siblings. As mentioned before, the identical twins are very close to their sister Chance. And in typical Gen.
