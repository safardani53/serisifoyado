Previously, he studied at Catawba College.</p><p>James Sr. was a football coach at their hometown’s football organization, Weddington Titans, and seeing him training the young boys for Pop Warner later inspired both his sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Will-Shipleys-Parents-James-And-Tammy-e1693905663634.jpeg><p>Growing up alongside his older brother, James Jr., Will started playing football when he was four.</p><p>On the other hand, their mother, Tammy, an NC State graduate, was a little strict regarding academics and kept education above everything. So, she always made sure the boys did their assignments before they went out to play games.</p><p>Despite that, Tammy was impressed by her kids’ athletic prowess and enjoyed seeing them competing and playing games together.&nbsp;</p><p>Tammy was happy when Will expressed his desire to become a professional athlete while still in high school. She had seen him improve so much as a player over the years, and by then, she was convinced he could do much better in sports than academics.</p><p>Nevertheless, he decided to continue his studies at Clemson University, where he is pursuing a degree in management alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>playing college football</a> for the Tigers.&nbsp;</p><p>His parents wholeheartedly support their son and are proud of what he has achieved so far. Their biggest dream now is to see Will win the national championship with Clemson and make it into the NFL following his graduation.</p><h2>Brother James Is A Lacrosse Player</h2><p>Will Shipley’s older brother, James Jr., is a lacrosse player for the Penn Quakers.</p><p>A graduate of Weddington HS, he was part of both high school football and lacrosse teams.</p><p>James was also his school’s lacrosse team captain and led his team to three state championships (2017, 2018, and 2019).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Will-Shipley-And-His-Older-Brother-James-Jr-e1693905920682.jpeg><p>Additionally, his football performance garnered several accolades, including the two-time football state championship (2016 and 2018) and Charlotte Football Player of the Year.</p><p>After completing school, he moved to Philadelphia to pursue his undergraduate degree in Business from the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Playing for the Pennsylvania Athletics, he earned an honorable mention in All-Ivy and Second-Team All-Ivy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDyKWjZquYnr2tsdhmp5qqlaPBtHnWoaZmmaKaequtzJ6qZpmemXq1rcymsGarmJ69rbHYaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sutton-fosters-husband-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sutton Foster Dating  Sutton Foster's Husband &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
