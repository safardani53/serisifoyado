I had a boyfriend at the time but we were smitten and cute and he was adorable,” Melissa says.</p><p>On their final day of filming, Ryan gave Melissa an expensive Bulova watch as a gift, which made her go "weak in the knees" and she admitted his "taste in bling" turned her on.</p><p>"There's a ridiculous moment in the Sabrina movie where Ryan looks at me and says in a throaty, whispered hush, 'I think what we need is a little less talk and a little more action'," she said.</p><p>"When I opened Ryan's gift, I couldn't agree more with this statement."</p><p>In a scene which could have been straight out of a movie, Melissa ran out of her trailer and jumped in front of his car to stop him leaving the set.</p><p>"Not sure whether to chastise or make out with him next, I decided to plant a big, fat kiss on his mouth without saying a word more," she wrote. "It was very dramatic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681807519.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/faa3b190-a431-4382-b7f2-dcbb34781f0e.jpg><p>The pair went back to her hotel room where they "fooled around all night" - but, after the brief fling, she decided to stay with her boyfriend.</p><p>Less in her favour was Ashton Kutcher, whom Melissa tried to get booted out of parties for making "smartass remarks".</p><p>She said: "Ashton and I just didn't get along."</p><h2>Drugs and steamy clinches at the Playboy mansion</h2><p>As Sabrina continued to soar in the ratings, Melissa’s partying got increasingly wild - and she later admitted to taking a lot of drugs.</p><p>"I experimented with weed, ecstasy, mushrooms and mescaline for about a year and a half," she says.</p><p>"I was kind of running with a bad crowd.”</p><p>During one of her wilder nights in 1999, Melissa hung out at the Playboy mansion and took ecstasy, before making out with a girl in a limo on the way home.</p><p>"That was my third or fourth time on ecstasy,” she revealed.</p><p>The following day she turned up at a shoot for lads’ mag Maxim, still high, and shot a controversial nude cover.</p><p>"I'd gone to the Playboy Mansion the night before and had a little too much fun, explored a little too much of that Playboy Mansion," Hart says.</p><p>"And so the next morning I rolled up to the Maxim photo shoot and I was pretty hungover and coming down. And here I was, having a full day of… hair extensions and bikinis, and I was not prepared for it - so that was probably the least professional I've ever been in my career."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682051123.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682048504.jpg><p>The famous cover - tagged with the line “Your favourite witch without a stitch'' - showed the former child star naked, holding a sheet to cover her chest.</p><p>The image almost got Melissa booted off the show, as Archie Comics tried to sue her for posing in the buff.</p><p>"Archie Comics had a contract that I would never play [Sabrina] naked,” she wrote.</p><p>“But then I did the cover of Maxim magazine, and for some reason – no idea how this happened – Maxim had the cover say 'Sabrina' instead of 'Melissa'.</p><p>"It was a big press scandal at the time my movie Drive Me Crazy was coming out. And so I wasn’t really able to enjoy the movie launch, because I was so focused on whether I was gonna get fired."</p><p>In fact, the scandal blew over and she stayed until 2003, but it proved a wake-up call and she knocked her drug use on the head.</p><p>“I just didn't enjoy taking drugs,” she said. “I don't like the loss of control.”</p><p>She also insisted she had never snorted or injected drugs and added: “The one time I was offered coke, which happened to be by Paris Hilton, I turned it down.” Paris has since denied the claim.</p><h2>From party animal to devoted mum</h2><p>By the time Sabrina ended, in 2003, Melissa had already met her future husband, Mark Wilkerson, at the Kentucky Derby and was ready to settle down.</p><p>The couple wed in Florence in July 2003 - three months after the final episode aired - and the preparations for the ceremony were filmed for a reality show, Tying The Knot.</p><p>The couple went on to have three boys - Mason, 15, Braydon, 11 and Tucker, nine - who are all child actors themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/675c2612-da03-4399-8054-4100383ea7ca.jpg><p>Tucker starred as the baby in Melissa’s long running sitcom, Melissa and Joey, while Braydon appeared in The Santa Con, a TV movie directed by his mum.</p><p>The family now live away from the bright lights of Hollywood in Nashville, and Melissa continues to work as an actor - most recently in the Netflix series No Good Nick - and director.</p><p>Now a devoted mum, who home-schooled her three boys in lockdown, Melissa hit the headlines in August when she became ill with Covid, despite being vaccinated.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The star’s memoir, Melissa Explains It All, came with the tagline "Tales from my abnormally normal life".</p><p>But her party days in Hollywood were anything but normal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681803600.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681803490.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Sabrina The Teenage Witch cast reunite 17 years after series ended</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZ2eCeIWTaKqamqKeu6J5056cp5mXmnq4tdOcn2allaG2tL%2FAZqGomZ5itaK%2B02g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-angela-sarafyan-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Angela Sarafyan Dating Now">&larr;
