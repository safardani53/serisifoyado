We weren’t using protection, and we knew instantly that this child was a gift from God," she said.</p><p>After the birth of their child, Shaw said she fell more in love with Ne-Yo and in 2010, Ne-Yo proposed at Fabolous' birthday party in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>"We were in a suite, and he told everybody to be quiet," she said.</p><p>"He pulled my hand, dropped down to one knee, and I immediately started crying. He incorporated the lyrics from his song Make Me Better and pulled out a 10-carat diamond ring."</p><p>Their relationship started to fall apart in 2011 when Shaw found out she was pregnant with their second child.</p><p>This time, she was on her own more often, living in <a href=#>Atlanta</a>, <a href=#>Georgia</a>, while Ne-Yo was working in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>"I told him, 'Our family should be in LA with you,' but he was adamant that his family grow up in Atlanta," Shaw said.</p><p>When it came time to give birth to their son, Mason, Shaw said Ne-Yo was in the hospital room with her and gave her a high five when their baby was born.</p><p>Immediately following Mason's birth, Shaw told the doctors she wanted them to burn her fallopian tubes.</p><p>It was a decision she said she and Ne-Yo had made in the months leading up to her due date.</p><p>They agreed that Ne-Yo would get a vasectomy as well to show their sole commitment to each other.</p><p>However, two months before their impending wedding, in June 2013, Ne-Yo called to tell Shaw that he didn't want to be in a monogamous relationship anymore.</p><p>Shortly after, Shaw saw Ne-Yo had entered a relationship with <a href=#>Crystal Renay</a> and learned he had never gone through with the vasectomy as he had allegedly promised.</p><p>It is a decision that Shaw says is her biggest regret.</p><p>"Now I look back and wonder what I was thinking," she said. "I love hard, and I made so many permanent decisions based on what I thought a man wanted from me, not what I wanted for myself.</p><p>"When my daughter comes of age, I will tell her: 'Your body is your temple. Don’t do anything to it you don’t want to regret.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751576129.jpg><h2>Is Moynetta Shaw married?</h2><p>In a star-studded event in November 2021, Shaw married Heath Carter at The Biltmore in Atlanta.</p><p>Carter is the CEO of several companies but it was his dedication to his children that drew Shaw to him.</p><p>She said that despite his busy schedule, Carter would always make time for his kids.</p><p>"I would literally see him rearrange his schedules, have huge deals on the table, and he’s like, ‘No, I have to go see my daughter, and I have to make sure this is done.’</p><p>"That honestly, was one of the main things that made me be like, ‘Oh my gosh.’ Just the love that he had for his children, first and foremost," she said on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly’s “Hot Hollywood” podcast</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Shaw said her connection to Carter was immediate and the post-marriage bliss has continued.</p><p>"I’m enjoying married life thoroughly. I really am," she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Essence</a>. We were together some years before but it’s nice to be married and just have that connection and [say] 'This is my husband, I’m your wife.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htaWh%2Fd3yPaKWeZamkwG6x12aeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZKannq6ytcDAZqqhmadk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-token-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Token Dating Now">&larr;
