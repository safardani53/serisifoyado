While it’s actually more convenient and enjoyable to buy undies online, feeling confident in the size, fit, and material can get a little tricky, so finding a brand or retailer that is reliable can be a total game-changer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s nothing better than finding a brand you know, trust, and love — a brand you can turn to time and time again when underwear shopping,” Jonathan Shokrian, the CEO of MeUndies, tells PEOPLE. Since underwear is something you wear every single day, you want to know for sure that you’re getting a pair you’ll love, so once you find your favorite place to buy underwear, it’s worth going back to when you're ready to stock up on more.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best places to buy underwear, Shokrian says to focus on fabric, fit, and customer experience (this includes that pesky return policy) to narrow down your search and find a reliable brand you love — and we couldn’t agree more. But, with so many underwear brands out there, you’re going to be sifting through the internet’s intimates for quite some time, so we decided to do it for you. After researching nearly 50 brands and retailers, we found the best places to buy underwear for all styles, sizes, and budgets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about the best places to buy underwear online.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-target></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Target</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for excellent value, Target is a fantastic place to shop for underwear.

In addition to these styles, EBY also features some gorgeous mesh designs, patterns, and more mid-rise thongs and briefs if that’s more your style. All EBY underwear is made from a buttery soft, breathable material with a cotton gusset for optimal hygiene.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-4XL | <strong>Return Policy: </strong>Unworn, unwashed items within 30 days of receipt | <strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping for members; free shipping on orders over $100 | <strong>Additional Payment Methods: </strong>Amazon Pay, PayPal, Google Pay, Afterpay</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-victorias-secret></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Victoria’s Secret</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Victoria's Secret</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Victoria’s Secret is a classic for underwear shopping — but that’s not really why we love it.

It’s also important that underwear is comfortable, so double-check that the underwear has plenty of stretch and will fit well without digging into or pinching your body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the health aspect, the material also matters when shopping for underwear to wear under specific clothing.

Not only does this make for a more comfortable experience and prevent unwanted visible panty lines, but it also impacts health. When shopping for underwear online, make sure the brands you browse carry styles in your size, and if you aren’t sure about the fit, consider the return policy to ensure you can exchange it for a different size.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Return Policy</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of the return policy, this is also important when looking at places to buy underwear.

However, this all depends on how you care for your undies and how much wear and tear they experience. And, in many cases, you can get away with wearing underwear for much longer. If your underwear starts to fray or becomes uncomfortable or too big due to being stretched out, it’s worth replacing for a pair that will stay in place. But, if your undies still fit well and don’t twist or have any damage, you can continue to wear them long after the one to two-year period.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As far as the best time to shop for underwear is concerned, you can always find great deals from popular underwear brands during certain sale seasons. Black Friday is a good time to stock up on more splurge-worthy brands, as many offer discounts during the sale event. Labor Day, Boxing Day, and other sale weekends like Memorial Day Weekend are also good shopping days. Additionally, you can find sales both on Amazon marketplace and individual brand websites during Amazon Prime Day.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.93187066974596><p><span class=accordion__title>What kind of underwear is most comfortable?</span></p><p>Underwear style is all about personal preference, however, the material makes a major difference in overall comfort.
