He has a younger sister named Jordan in the family.</p><p>Born and brought up in New York, he studied in a local school until he reached Grade three.</p><p>However, he later got a scholarship to study at Greenwich Country Day School, one of America’s most prestigious private schools.</p><p>His father, Donovan Sr., was a former Minor League Baseball player and used to work in an executive post for the New York Mets when he was a kid.</p><p>So, he learned about baseball from a very young age.</p><p>However, he was interested in sports, mainly baseball and basketball. He was very energetic and sportive, so he always liked to go out to play with other kids in the locality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Donovan-with-his-mother-Nicole.jpg><p>But, his mother, Nicole, was a school teacher and wanted her son to focus more on his studies. She was skeptical about her son making his career in sports, so she had worked very hard to send her son to an elite school.</p><p>However, Donovan felt it hard to adapt to the new school environment where the students were primarily white and affluent.</p><p>As someone coming from a middle-class family, he often went hungry, not being able to afford mid-day meals.</p><p>On the other hand, his mother always cared for her children’s happiness and endured much. She never let them know about her difficulties in paying household expenses.</p><p>Being aware of his mother’s hardships, he began being serious from a carefree child to a conscious high schooler. He graduated high school from Brewster Academy in 2015.</p><h2>Donovan Mitchell | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>After graduating from Greenwich Day School, he attended two different schools and played high school basketball with them for two years each.&nbsp;</p><p>Mitchell initially studied at Canterbury School in Connecticut, where he played both baseball and basketball in his first and second years. However, he stopped playing baseball after injuring his wrist as a sophomore.</p><p>Moreover, he transferred to the Brewster Academy in New Hampshire and played his last two high school basketball seasons for them.</p><p>He performed well from the start, and he grew pretty popular among his teammates and coaches alike.</p><p>During his two years there, Donovan led the Brewster to two prep school national championship victories and got chances to play in different places, including the Jordan Brand Classic All-Star game.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&nbsp;David Andersen: Career, Net Worth & More >>></strong></a></p><h3>College Career</h3><p>In his senior high school year, Donovan had received scholarship offers from various universities, including Kansas, Georgetown, etc. However, he joined the University of Louisville for his college basketball.</p><p>His performance in the first season was very average. As a freshman, he averaged 7.4 points and 3.4 rebounds per game.</p><p>But, he had already made up his mind to join the NBA before finishing college. First, however, he had to drastically improve his performance if he were to make that dream come true.</p><p>As a sophomore, he averaged 15.6 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. Moreover, he earned a place in the First Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference for his performance.</p><p>Eventually, he felt confident enough to go for the NBA draft and declared for it immediately after his sophomore season in 2017.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The Denver Nuggets chose Mitchell as the 2017 NBA draft’s first-round thirteenth pick.

However, as many other athletes contacted the virus, the NBA suspended the league until a few months later.</p><p>He finished the season with an average of 24.0 points per game. Likewise, he extended his contract with the club for five years more.</p><h4>Later seasons & Injuries</h4><p>Mitchell’s fourth NBA season was the best in terms of his performance. He averaged a career-best 26.4 points per game.</p><p>However, it was also his worst because he got to play only around 53 matches in the entire season. He suffered an ankle injury in April, due to which he missed sixteen games.</p><p>However, he later played in the playoffs despite the injury.</p><p>The ongoing 2021-22 NBA season is on par with his performances in the previous seasons.
