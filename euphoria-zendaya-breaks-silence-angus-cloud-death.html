For all of the boundless light, love and joy he always managed to give us. I’ll cherish every moment."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE on Angus Cloud">READ MORE on Angus Cloud</h2><p>The actress concluded: "My heart is with his mother and family at this time and please be kind and patient as grief looks different for everyone."</p><p>Fans were quick to comment on Zendaya's tribute as one person wrote: "You always know exactly what to say. Definitely thinking of you and hoping you’re holding up okay..."</p><p>Another added: "Beautiful words... Sending you and his loved ones love and strength," while a third user said, "We send you a big hug!"</p><p>On Monday, <a aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> broke the news that the star had died at 25, but details were initially sparse.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The outlet has since learned from Oakland <a href=#>Police</a> that <a href=#>Angus' mother</a>, Lisa, <a href=#>called 911</a> at around 11.30am on Monday morning, reporting a "<a href=#>possible overdose</a>."</p><p>She said on the phone that her son did not have a pulse.</p><p>Emergency first responders pronounced the actor <a href=#>dead</a> on the scene.</p><p>A source close to the rising star told TMZ that Angus had been dealing with suicidal thoughts upon returning <a href=#>home</a> to California from Ireland for his father's funeral.</p><h2><strong>'DEVASTATING LOSS'</strong></h2><p>He was reportedly staying at his family's home while he attempted to overcome the grief he was dealing with.</p><p>The family told the outlet: "... "Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend.</p><p>"Angus was open about his battle with <a href=#>mental health</a> and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence."</p><p>The statement concluded: "We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss."</p><p>Just three days before his death, Angus was seen in public at a debut album launch party for MacArthur Maze, a Bay Area-based rap group, The <a href=#>U.S. Sun exclusively revealed</a>.</p><h2><strong>'I WAS TRAPPED'</strong></h2><p>Angus had previously opened up to <a href=# aria-label="Variety (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> about surviving a near-death experience, revealing the cause of the large scar on his head which was visible on <a href=#>Euphoria</a>.</p><p>He shared in the interview that he fell into a construction pit while walking at night when he was 15.</p><p>"I woke up 12 hours later at the bottom. I was trapped," Angus recalled, as he eventually climbed out of the pit and took a bus to see his mom.</p><p>"It was hella hard to climb out because my skull was broken, but my skin wasn't, so all the bleeding was internal, pressing up against my brain," Angus shared, as he also praised his mom for saving his life.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He revealed: "I would have died. She gave me some water, and I started throwing up hella mouthfuls of crimson red blood. S**t was crazy.</p><p>"So then my mama took me to the children's hospital, and they saved my life. That's what the scar's from. They cut my head open, they put some screws and a plate over where I broke my skull and s**t, sealed me back up, and that was that."</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/2019-cloud-best-known-role-835383287.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/angus-cloud-cast-member-hbo-835389712.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2l%2FeoSXaJyuqJikv6qtjLOcp5yRrq5urtGemKSrXai2rbHNnJxmmZ6cwrR5wqWmrpxdmbKiwMdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./giselle-blondet-s-marriage-divorce-story-it-seems-she-s-dating-a-new-man.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giselle Blondet's Marriage &amp;amp; Divorce Story: It Seems She's Dating A New Man">&larr;
