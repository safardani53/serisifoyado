You do not wear a vest top like that, even if you are going to the gym or shopping, without being happy for your nipples to be showing.</p><p>“It also looks as if she has tucked it up to show her muscly abs and slim waist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kanye-west-seen-good-spirits-817314015-1.jpg><p>“She might have pulled the top into a knot at the back to make it even tighter. Tucking it also gives the shadow underneath the breasts in photos.</p><p>"This accentuates the size of her breasts and makes them look as if they are bigger.</p><p>“The top is also white against her skin. There is also very little support in this top which means she wants to show off her body as well.</p><p>“Her top is quite see-through so it is not just showing her nipples. You can see the shape of her boobs.</p><p>“Bianca is a big-busted lady and she’s showing off everything.”</p><h2>NO SKIMS, NO PROBLEM</h2><p>Back in March, Carolyn again shared her opinion on Bianca's braless L.A. outings, speculating that they <a href=#>are premeditated events</a>.</p><p>She also thinks the 28-year-old is snubbing&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian’s</a>&nbsp;Skims brand by saying no “to a load of foundation garments.”</p><p>Recently,&nbsp;<a href=#>Bianca Censori</a>&nbsp;was spotted out&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shopping in Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;decked out in tight black spandex clothes, stiletto boots, and a neutral beanie hat.</p><p>And while the former jewelry designer wandered happily along Melrose Place with her husband&nbsp;Kanye, it appeared the&nbsp;<a href=#>celebrity's</a>&nbsp;tightly put-together look didn't include a bra.</p><p>In another exclusive interview,&nbsp;Professor Carolyn Mair Ph.D.&nbsp;told The U.S. Sun: “For Bianca, there appears to have been several times it looks as if she isn't wearing a bra in public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/christopher-peterson-splashnews-com-yeezy-788213766-1.jpg><p>“For example, in the image where she's wearing the beanie, it looks like she's not wearing a bra.</p><p>“Bianca may have made the decision not to wear a bra knowing she could be photographed.</p><p>“She might think that being pictured not wearing a bra will make her look as if she's sexier as our breasts are more likely to move if we don't wear one.</p><p>“I don't know if these are her own boobs or not, but she will attract attention regardless because her breasts would move when she walks. When something moves, we look as movement attracts our attention.</p><p>“The decision to go braless is associated with being sexy and possibly because it means there would be nothing underneath the outer layer.</p><p>“Or perhaps Bianca might be saying, ‘I don't need underwear or Skims.’</p><p>“Bianca could also be saying, ‘I'm letting it all hang out,’ and this is because Skims sucks the body in.</p><p>“Bianca has a similar body shape to Kim and so what she might be expressing through her look, is that her body doesn't need Skims.</p><p>“We have one woman who’s obviously not into Skims and one of them is who is. Contrasting with Kim, she could be saying that she doesn't need a load of foundation garments.”</p><h2><strong>THE YE-S HAVE IT</strong></h2><p>Kanye shocked fans by marrying Bianca in a top-secret ceremony in January.</p><p>The hitmaker&nbsp;<a href=#>tied the knot</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Bianca&nbsp;just two months after his divorce was finalized from&nbsp;Kim, according to reports.</p><p>Although it was initially rumored the ceremony was in&nbsp;Los Angeles, an insider told The U.S. Sun they exchanged vows at the $5,000-a-night&nbsp;<a href=#>Amangiri Resort</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=#>Utah</a>.</p><p>Bianca recently <a href=#>confirmed her marriage to Kanye</a> in a new fan video shared on TikTok.</p><p>Bianca was captured in a&nbsp;<a href=#>fan's TikTok video</a>&nbsp;as she was out shopping for a pair of "shorts."</p><p>In the clip, she finally confirmed her marriage to&nbsp;Kanye, as neither has publicly spoken on the matter despite reportedly tying the knot in January.</p><p>The blonde was seated in the hat section of a high-end retailer when the user&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@gratefulboynuee</a>&nbsp;began recording.</p><p>The model wore no makeup and her pixie haircut slicked back, keeping her&nbsp;<a href=#>style</a>&nbsp;casual in a black zippered hoodie.</p><p>"You're sexy, my name Nue," he told Bianca, who smiled and replied: "Thank you, nice to meet you."</p><p>He asked: "You from LA?" to which she responded: "Yes."</p><p>"Okay, I just moved out here," Nue replied.</p><p>"Where are you from?" Bianca asked, and the user explained: "Chicago."</p><p>"Nice!" Kanye's wife added.</p><p>"You got good eye contact," Nue complimented, and Bianca laughed into the camera.</p><p>"Are you just shopping around?" she asked, but her phone started ringing.</p><p>"Yeah, you?" he asked, to which she replied: "Yeah same there was just a pair of shorts I wanted to see."</p><p>"Can I get your number?" Nue asked, but Bianca said: "I'm married!"</p><p>The TikTok user said: "Damn," before ending the clip.</p><p>Fans were astonished by Kanye's wife's kind demeanor in the clip, taking to the comments to compliment her behavior toward the stranger.</p><p>"She's so cute," one gushed, while a second wrote: "She looks so different so up close, she has a sweet personality, not stuck up at all."</p><p>"She's stunning. Good energy as well, I like her already," a third agreed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I think she's adorable and I'm happy for her and Ye," a fourth commented.</p><p>"Wow she friendly," a fifth claimed, while a final remarked: "Aww she's so cute to me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/yes-lady-kanye-wests-wife-819095341-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kanye-west-s-wife-bianca-803018740-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kanye-west-s-wife-bianca-803017718-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYW2AdICPaKqenV2grq%2FFxGaunqukqHq4tcWeZJuhkaOwonnCnqWsp6KewG65zqyrZqajm8RuuM6ooqxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-john-oleary-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is John O'Leary Dating Now">&larr;
