During his childhood, he wanted to start a successful band under his name.</p><p>But destiny has another surprise in store for him that is far greater than that. It also provided him with an acting opportunity.</p><p>He made his acting debut in 1984, and his first film was A Nightmare on Elm Street, a horror film. And Johnny just nailed that character itself, which helped him capture more different movie offers.</p><p>Then he started to act in a series of movies like Platoon, Cry-Baby, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Benny and Joon, Donnie Brasco, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, etc.</p><p>The year 2000 was the turning point of his life because he got the chance to enter the world of Walt Disney movies, and yes, that is everyone’s favourite “Pirates of the Caribbean Sea.”</p><p>Then his career took off, and in 2012, Johnny Depp was listed by Guinness World Records as having the highest-paid salary!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Johnny_Depp_Ethnicity></span>What is Johnny Depp Ethnicity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Johnny-Depp.jpg><p>Johnny Depp’s ethnicity was one of the most trending questions on Google searches for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Due to his flawless British, Irish, and Australian English language accent.</li><li>Controversy related to pretending issues regarding his native.</li></ul><p>Well, let us straightaway come to the absolute answer:</p><p>Johnny Depp’s ethnicity belongs to native Americans, but when we decode his surname “Depp”, it has spread his ethnic roots to German, Irish, and French.</p><p>And it was derived from the famous French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700.</p><p>But evolution is the most vital thing in human life, so we couldn’t confirm his ethnicity by these mere facts because that immigrant was a person who lived around 500 years ago.</p><p>So, it is wiser to check about his great- and great-grandfather’s details. And we have collected the details about Johnny Depp’s great-grandmother.</p><p>And she was a native American, and she was from the region of the Cherokee or Creek Indians.</p><p>Thus, Johnny Depp’s ethnic roots are spread across the Kentucky region. So, Johnny Depp is an American by ethnicity.</p><p>Even though he can excel in all types of English accents effortlessly,</p><p>Here is Johnny Depp’s statement regarding his ethnicity:</p><p>“I guess I have some Native American (in me) somewhere down the line.”</p><p>My great-grandmother was quite a bit of a Native American; she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.”</p><p>Let’s take some of these additional biography details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Johnny_Depp_Biography_Details></span>Johnny Depp Biography Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Johnny-Depp-image.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Johnny_Depp_Age></span>What is Johnny Depp Age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Johnny Depp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky.
