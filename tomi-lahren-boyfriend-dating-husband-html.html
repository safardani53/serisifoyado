Yet in 2017, she made an unprecedented move in one of the highly reputed progressive shows, The View. Her pro-abortion statement on the show got her own conservative show&nbsp;suspended. However, sometime later, she found safe heaven at FOX News as a contributor and debuted in the famous show Hannity. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr>Previously, the South Dakota native was best known around the world as the host of Tomi Lahren show on Glen Beck owned magazine, The Blaze, before being suspended for her pro-abortion statement that she had made on The View.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr><strong>Hosting Messages:</strong> Tomi Lahren speaks&nbsp;off on the Democrat Party's message heading into the midterm elections&nbsp;(Published on 19 Sep&nbsp;2018 )</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Interesting</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=# title="Rhea Seehorn Excitedly Getting Married To Partner!
