Saquon Barkley is an American football running back who currently plays for the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL). He was a standout running back at Penn State, where he was recognized as one of the finest in the nation. Barkley was taken as the second overall selection in the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. Despite multiple injuries throughout his professional career, the athlete is regarded as one of the most gifted running backs in the NFL and is recognized for his speed, agility, and ability to make opponents miss.</p><p>On and off the field, the athlete has been hailed for his hard ethic and leadership. Saquon’s death was just announced after followers believed his death hoax. However, it is unfounded and untrue since the athlete is living and causing a feeling. He recently gained headlines after he rejected a playoff contract offer from the New York Giants for roughly $13 million per season. According to one NFL agent, his selection was a “dumb move.” Nonetheless, let’s talk about Saquon Barkley’s death hoax and his health update in this post.</p><h2>Saquon Barkley’s Death Hoax</h2><p>Recently, there was a popular death hoax involving Saquon Barkley in which it was claimed that the athlete was shot some minutes earlier while eating supper.&nbsp;According to the satirical website, Saquon was fatally shot, and although medical personnel and police officers raced to the scene, the culprit escaped and was unable to be apprehended. The website also encourages visitors to return for additional information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Saquon-Barkley-1.jpg alt="Saquon Barkley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They are, however, all bogus tales and news since the athlete is alive, healthy, and playing. Furthermore, the sportsman has been the victim of several death hoaxes throughout his playing career.&nbsp;These hoaxes often feature bogus social media postings or news pieces announcing the death of the New York Giants running back, frequently after false claims of the cause of death. It’s not uncommon for sportsmen and famous people to be the targets of such death hoaxes, which spread swiftly on social media and other online platforms, capturing the interest of many.&nbsp;It’s usually a good idea to double-check things before releasing them, particularly when dealing with delicate topics like death. And, in the case of Saquon, his agents have confirmed that he is alive, so his supporters don’t have to worry.</p><h2>Saquon Barkley Health</h2><p>Despite suffering several injuries in recent years, Saquon Barkley is doing great and well. Still thinking about his previous injuries, he tore his ACL during the 2020 NFL season, forcing him to miss the rest of the season.&nbsp;He had surgery to fix the damage and started therapy to restore knee strength and mobility.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Saquon-Barkley-1.jpg alt="Saquon Barkley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There were rumors leading up to the 2021 NFL season that Barkley was making progress in his recuperation and was on schedule to return to the field for the Giants.&nbsp;Despite several injuries throughout the years, Saquon has continued to play with zeal for his NFL side, the New York Giants.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Giants gave him the non-exclusive franchise tag on March 7, 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqmlpLtursCroqWdqWK1pq3LrZ9mraCZrrWxjLCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6qbXMZpuemaSdeqm7wLFknZ2SqrusscNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taya-rogerss-boyfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taya Rogerss Boyfriend: Who is Taya Rogers Dating?">&larr;
