The only Chelsea player I've ever slept with is Ashley Cole.</p><p>"I used to go out with him years ago when I was 20."</p><h3><strong>Stephen Bear</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000325846939.jpg><p>Jemma and Bear were inseparable for several months and even got matching tattoos together during their romance.</p><p>The pair kept tight-lipped about their budding relationship&nbsp;- until&nbsp;<a href=#>Jemma Lucy went on a sensational Twitter rant, in which she claimed Bear had cheated on her</a>.</p><p>In May,&nbsp;pals admitted she had really fallen for Bear, and&nbsp;<a href=#>was even still in love with him</a>.</p><p>Speaking to MTV, Bear revealed: “We had a good month together, and we even got matching tattoos so when we held hands it would become a heart.</p><p>“Now when I get married, I don’t think a girl would want another girl on my hand.”</p><p>She later branded him “for a good time, not a long time”.</p><h3><strong>Kirk Norcross</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jj1.jpg><p>During her first appearance on Ex on the Beach in season three, Jemma charmed and eventually bedded Kirk Norcross.</p><p>However, she was left less than impressed and later told everyone about their x-rated night of fun.</p><p>"I did like Kirk but I wasn’t amazed by his sexual ability, especially considering how many girls he’d had sex with," she told Daily Star Online.</p><p>"He literally lasted three seconds and I did all the work.</p><p>"I was a bit blinded by liking him on the show but his d*** isn’t even that big."<br></p><h3><strong>Ashley Cain</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eotb1.jpg><p>Fuelled by booze, anger and jealousy, Ashley and Jemma leaped into bed together during the fifth season of Ex on the Beach – leaving Kayleigh Morris fuming.</p><p>The fall out of the sex session resulted in Jemma being kicked off of the show as the 29-year-old's scrap with her love rival got physical.</p><p>Kayleigh interrupted them in the middle of their tryst and refused to leave the room – causing the girls to scrap.</p><p>Jemma later quipped: "Sex with Ashley is f***ing dirty - and that's how I like it."<br></p><h3><strong>Gaz Beadle</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000264717056.jpg><p>She later defended their romp and said: "I&nbsp;was put in a situation in a penthouse with someone very attractive, I got drunk and I did get with Gaz.</p><p>"I probably shouldn't have.</p><p>"But I have a very high sex drive and,&nbsp;at end of the day, he put his d**k in me."<br></p><h3><strong>David Hawley</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0003430766971-e1504079587787.jpg><p>Hawley and Jemma clashed when they were reunited on Ex on the Beach – with Jemma frequently breaking down and revealing she even still loved him.</p><p>However on screen it didn’t work out, and after she confessed to sleeping with his best mate after an argument, she was left seething as he moved on to other women.</p><p>In 2017, he branded her “absolute venom” as she entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, and declared he wanted nothing more to do with her.<br></p><h3><strong>Scotty T</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0003461832721.jpg><p>In a bid to start things with Hawley on a clean slate, she confessed to him that she had slept with Scotty T during a wild night out – leaving him furious.</p><p>However, Scotty denied he had ever bedded the tattooed beauty, and in response she gave a detailed account of their tryst in Weston-Super-Mare after a nightclub appearance together.</p><p>"We left, got in the taxi, him and her were kissing, then he'd kiss me, grabbing me around my waist, but then he'd keep stopping.”</p><p>"I will give him that, he knew he shouldn't be doing what he was,” she continued. “He's not completely dead inside, he's only half dead inside."<br></p><h3><strong>Marty McKenna</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000284740754-e1504079744841.jpg><p><a href=#>Marty McKenna</a> was revealed to be one of Jemma's exes on Season 3 of Ex on the Beach - shortly before he joined the cast of Geordie Shore.</p><p>After washing up on shore, both enjoyed flings with other people in the house, but never reignited their own romance.</p><p>However, they enjoyed a brief reunion shortly after they got back from the villa, and they were seen tashing on in nightclubs less than a week later.</p><p>Since then, both have moved on to other people, with Marty's most notable relationship being with Geordie Shore co-star Chloe Ferry.</p><h3><strong>Laura-Alicia Summers</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/la1.jpg><p>Laura and Jemma became the first lesbian couple to appear on Ex on the Beach – and was Jemma’s first major introduction into the limelight she’s in now.</p><p>The pair dated briefly for two months during their time on the show, and both identify as bisexual.</p><p>Feisty Jemma said their relationship fell apart at the time because they kept getting into arguments.<br></p><h3><strong>Chantelle Connelly</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0003200098481.jpg><p>Jemma was connected to former Geordie Shore star Chantelle earlier this year – and soon they were pictures sharing loved-up holidays and snogging on nights out together.</p><p>However, after a few months their “romance” died out and they are now on less than positive terms.</p><p>Jury’s still out as to whether or not their relationship was real or one for the cameras – with differing accounts of the situation coming from both sides.</p><p>Either way, it was complicated.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhsY2mEeIOSaKGepZ2Weq3BwrJkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dqmafmae5p77InqWdq12XtrSx166YpWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celeb-hot-spot-9-jones-is-new-yorks-sexy-supper-club-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celeb Hot Spot 9 Jones Is New Yorks Sexy Supper Club: Details">&larr;
