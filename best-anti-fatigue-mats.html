We're big fans of using anti-fatigue mats in our homes and office spaces, but with so many great options out there, it can be hard to narrow down which styles are really worth your money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If improving your joint health is important to you, then adding an anti-fatigue mat or two in areas like the space below your standing desk, next to your bed, or in front of your sink can make a world of difference. We tested 16 anti-fatigue mats to discover which products deserve the PEOPLE Tested stamp of approval.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are our favorite anti-fatigue mats for everyday use.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-sky-solutions-sky-mat-075-inch-comfort-anti-fatigue-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sky Solutions Sky Mat Comfort Anti-Fatigue Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=sky-solutions-sky-mat-comfort-anti-fatigue-mat style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y8MPgOWeCCe3VnGZX0PRTRwOkcE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sky-solutions-sky-mat-comfort-anti-fatigue-mat-00c52d2cf649445f8eb63e1bcfe34351.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It has a memory foam cushion which nicely molded around our feet.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The mat comes in a variety of shades and patterns to suit your space.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The smooth surface is easy to wipe clean.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>None that we could find.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There was no contest regarding which style performed the best during our tests, as the Sky Solutions Anti-Fatigue Mat scored the best across categories of design, comfort, ease of cleaning, and more. Its memory foam material allowed for the mat to mold around our feet, providing firm support and cloud-like cushion. The variety of colors and patterns made this mat a great choice for anyone looking to add a bit of comfort to their space, as its versatility offers options for any style of decor. However, we suggest that you pick the black shade over a color if you want to disguise small messes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were impressed by the easy cleaning process; during testing, we watched flour and molasses rinse right off the mat. Compared to anti-fatigue mats with textured surfaces, this one's smooth exterior made cleaning a breeze — making this the perfect option for a kitchen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, no mat is one-size-fits-all — and thankfully, this style comes in five different dimensions to accommodate your space — whether under a standing desk or in your kitchen. We wished the mat we tested was a bit larger, but since this option is available in several different sizes, you can get the proper ratio for your space. From its comfortable 0.75-inch cushion to the attractive price point, we found the most favor with the Sky Solutions Anti Fatigue Mat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Outside Material: </strong>N/A | <strong>Inside Material: </strong>Memory foam | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 32 x 20 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.74 pounds | <strong>Shape: </strong>Rectangle | <strong>Thickness: </strong>0.75 inches | <strong>Non-Slip: </strong>Yes | <strong>Color Options:</strong> 16 | <strong>Surface Texture: </strong>Diamond | <strong>Tapered Edge: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-featol-standing-desk-mat-foam-cushioned-anti-fatigue-mats-comfort-standing-pad></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FEATOL Anti Fatigue Mats Comfort Standing Pad</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FEATOL Standing Desk Mat Foam Cushioned Anti Fatigue Mats Comfort Standing Pad" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jzvZA1yQTrJKXf161VxP6xOsDKY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/featol-standing-desk-mat-foam-909cdfa5a6fb4b578ddda389fccda8ed.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a great price, this cushy mat was our top contender with the most attractive (and we do mean lowest) price point. After standing on the mat for an hour, we thought the 0.90-inch gel and memory foam material (the thickest cushion on our list) was the standout quality. The longer we stood on this mat, the more our feet started to sink in and carve out a mold. Staying true to its memory foam core, this mat supports a contouring cushion for long days spent on your feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The PU leather exterior is detailed with a non-slip woven surface, and while pleasing to the eye, it could create potential cleaning issues. After the mess test with molasses and flour, we noticed that the grooves made this mat a bit hard to clean. However, if you plan to use this mat under your standing desk, your chance of spilling molasses is pretty slim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Outside Material: </strong>PU leather | <strong>Inside Material: </strong>Gel and memory foam | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 32 x 20 inches<strong> </strong>|<strong> Weight:</strong> 5.14 pounds<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shape: </strong>Rectangle | <strong>Thickness:</strong> 0.90 inches | <strong>Non-Slip: </strong>Yes | <strong>Color Options:</strong> 1 | <strong>Surface texture: </strong>Textured | <strong>Tapered edge: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-cactus-mat-2200-35-vip-cloud-anti-fatigue-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cactus VIP Cloud Anti-Fatigue Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cactus Mat 2200-35 VIP Cloud Anti-Fatigue Mat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dcYvR0ncpTE3jsWMD8vgeKXczBs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cactus-mat-2200-35-vip-cloud-anti-fatigue-mat-9b222ad5ea7d45819620e1ef6f30631a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the Cactus Mat retails higher than others on our list, its large dimensions more than justify its price tag. At 60 by 35 inches, this mat answers our earlier wishes for a comfortable and large anti-fatigue mat. The Cactus ended up being the largest mat we tested, and it's not much more expensive than some of the higher-end, smaller kitchen mats we tried — making it well worth the price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ideal for office spaces, this nondescript mat provides just the right amount of cushion for people with a larger walking path. While it's not specifically meant for home use, self-professed chefs or home cooks may prefer the extra width of this mat as they flit around the kitchen. We think that at this size, you could move between your counter, sink, and stove, all without stepping foot on the floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting that because of its larger size, this anti-fatigue mat would need to be dragged outside to clean up after a long day in the kitchen. However, its thick nitrile rubber cushion is supportive enough to support the bottoms of your feet all day long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Outside Material: </strong>Non-absorbent "closed-cell" nitrile rubber | <strong>Inside Material:</strong> N/A | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 60 x 35 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 14 pounds | <strong>Shape: </strong>Rectangle | <strong>Thickness: </strong>0.75 inches | <strong>Non-Slip: </strong>Yes | <strong>Color options:</strong> 1 | <strong>Surface Texture: </strong>Honeycomb | <strong>Tapered Edge: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-under-desk-gorilla-grip-anti-fatigue-cushioned-comfort-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Under-Desk</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gorilla Grip Anti Fatigue Cushioned Comfort Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gorilla Grip Anti Fatigue Cushioned Comfort Mat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/odGR_o3Vj9b7SLAGMIH-1iyou4E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gorilla-Grip-Anti-Fatigue-Cushioned-Comfort-Mat-1c3ffa38dd614bb4896750f12e0ffd24.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>It has a non-slip, pebbled surface.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This mat was very easy to clean.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes in tons of color options to suit your space.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We truly loved testing the Gorilla Grip Anti-Fatigue Mat thanks to its equally comfortable and sturdy material. Coming in at 32 by 30 inches, this is the perfect mat for slipping under a standing desk or placing it at the base of your counter for long days on your feet. Its high-density foam helped cushion our feet without collapsing our arches or making our feet feel uncomfortable in any way. A huge perk was its easy-to-clean pebbled rubber surface, which can be wiped down or even hosed in the case of a more significant spill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did think that our heels could have used a bit more support after an hour of testing, but seeing as this mat was brand new (and these usually have a break-in period), we're willing to overlook that for its reasonable price, superb comfort, and hefty color options (12!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Outside Material: </strong>Rubber | <strong>Inside Material: </strong>Foam | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 32 x 20 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.85 pounds |<strong> Shape: </strong>Rectangle | <strong>Thickness: </strong>1.25 inches | <strong>Non-Slip: </strong>No | <strong>Color Options:</strong> 12 | <strong>Surface Texture: </strong>Pebbled | <strong>Tapered Edge: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-commercial-grade-gelpro-newlife-anti-fatigue-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Commercial Grade</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GelPro Anti Fatigue Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=962 data-sizes=750px alt="GelPro NewLife Anti Fatigue Mat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7rIyq13YQLQc1STXPf4qbzZwL2E=/fit-in/1500x962/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GelPro-Anti-Fatigue-Mat-aee646faab1847bd8ea15d30fcb39b2e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>GelPro</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This mat has a sturdy, non-slip design.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It contains a circulation-improving biofoam core.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's a great choice for high-traffic spaces.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with an energy-returning biofoam, this non-slip ergonomic mat is great for high-volume foot traffic and office use. Its beveled edges prevent sliding when walking, and its standard 0.75-inch cushion provides comfortable support to tired feet. So whether you're stopping to refill at the water cooler or placing this mat under your standing desk, the GelPro mat could be a welcome addition to your workspace. It only comes in one color — black — which gives it more of an industrial appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we wished that this mat was a bit bigger (we tested the 32 x 20-inch size), there are larger options available, and the comfort and support that this biofoam option provided outweighed its size. Its smooth exterior allowed for an easy clean as well — not as effortless as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sky Solutions option</a>, but just a wash and a few rinses did the job.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Outside Material: </strong>Polyurethane foam | <strong>Inside Material: </strong>Biofoam<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 32 x 20 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 4.5 pounds |<strong> Shape: </strong>Rectangle | <strong>Thickness: </strong>0.75 inches | <strong>Non-Slip: </strong>Yes | <strong>Color Options:</strong> 1 | <strong>Surface Texture: </strong>Smooth | <strong>Tapered Edge: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cushion-comfilife-anti-fatigue-floor-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cushion</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ComfiLife Anti-Fatigue Floor Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ComfiLife Anti Fatigue Floor Mat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/i9k_-R1N_5qxTuguGfKBzbIsYmM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/81GvNnbHEhL._AC_SL1500_-0fcbf70edeef46b5a41398a96206cdc3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The no-curl beveled edge keeps it flush to the ground throughout use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes in several colors and shades.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This mat has a non-slip bottom.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>None that we could find.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adding an anti-fatigue mat to your home may seem like a no-brainer, but not every mat is right for your space — that is until you get acquainted with the ComfiLife Anti-Fatigue Floor Mat. This features a 0.75-inch thick cushion for superior support.

"Anti-fatigue or standing mats are designed to offload stress to the foot and body associated with prolonged standing. Some mats provide cushion, whereas others provide irregular surfaces or texture to stimulate and massage the feet," says New York City podiatrist Emily Splichal, D.P.M.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Uber-comfortable anti-fatigue mats are often made from memory foam, which is ideal for shoppers looking for a surface to comfortably contour to the shape of their feet for support and comfort — not unlike how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>memory foam mattresses</a> cushion the body. Another popular material is biofoam, which claims to release energy back into your ligaments to activate the muscles in your footbed as you stand (take the <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">GelPro NewLife EcoPro</a>, for example). Additionally, your mat's exterior can complicate your cleaning process, as textured surfaces hold more grime than smoother ones.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Thickness</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most anti-fatigue mats range from 0.25 to 1 inch thick. The right thickness is a matter of personal preference. The most comfortable and supportive anti-fatigue mats are generally at least 0.5 inches thick, and commercial grade mats typically don't drop below 0.38 inches, so anything thinner likely won't provide you with longterm support. You’ll also want to consider the amount of time you’ll be standing on the mat each day and whether or not you’ll be wearing shoes (which also add support and cushioning) when deciding on thickness.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To choose the right size mat, measure the size of the area where you’ll be using it. If you have a large, open area, you may opt for a larger mat that allows you to move around freely without stepping on and off the mat. Alternatively, if you plan to use your anti-fatigue mat in front of the kitchen sink or under a standing desk, you can choose a smaller mat that just fits that footprint.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Purpose</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just as different rooms have different purposes, the anti-fatigue mat you choose for different areas should have unique roles as well. For example, you wouldn't want an oddly-shaped standing mat to be the style you choose for a bustling kitchen, just like you wouldn't want a mat that's too large under your desk. However, it is important to keep an eye out for non-slip mats no matter which room it ends up in, as they should all serve the purpose of keeping you upright.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After all, an anti-fatigue mat is part of your room, so it should match your personal style or the atmosphere of your space, which is why it may be important to choose a mat that has multiple color and pattern options (we suggest the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">House of Noa Nama Standing Mat</a> for an aesthetically-pleasing print or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gorilla Grip</a> mat for color options).

It is advisable to let your mat dry completely before putting it back on the floor to prevent trapping moisture between it and the floor. Make sure you keep an eye out for mats that have low-maintenance surfaces, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Basics</a> mat that has a rubber surface, which allows spills to be hosed or wiped right off.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96941489361702><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the health benefits of anti-fatigue mats?</span></p><p>These tools alleviate the impact transferred to the joints and spinal column when walking and standing on hard floors.

Splichal recommends "looking for a mat that can activate, release, and offload the foot during prolonged standing."
