Ryan asked.</p><p>Kelly exclaimed: "I did not realize!"</p><p>Adam leaned forward and murmured, "I just wanted to tell you, I am enjoying the show."</p><p>The audience broke out into laughter and clapped for Adam.</p><p>"Yeah!" he exclaimed and took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>"You have a supportive friend!" Kelly told Jennifer, and they continued the show.</p><p>Later, Adam posed for a photo with Kelly, Ryan, and Jennifer.</p><h2>INTERVIEW MISHAP</h2><p>Holly Willoughby was <a href=#>forced to apologize</a> on This Morning after Jennifer Aniston swore during a live interview.</p><p>The Friends star dropped a "s**ts and giggles" during the interview to promote the new Netflix comedy caper Murder Mystery 2, leaving Phillip Schofield chuckling as his co-star scrambled to apologize.</p><p>Unfazed Jennifer, who was speaking via video link alongside co-star Adam Sandler in Paris, casually said "I'm sure you can bleep that", seemingly unaware the interview was taking place live.</p><p>It came while the pair were being quizzed on the film's stunts.</p><p>Adam said: "There's real. There's some creation, but Jennifer was scared to fall off the Eiffel Tower. They called 'action' and she didn't jump and I just snuck up and pushed her. It was fun to see that reaction."</p><p id=amp-readmore-target>Phil responded: "I can imagine, someone pretending to push you off the Eiffel Tower. What fun!"</p><p>Jennifer then said "Just for s**ts for giggles," before clasping her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Holly immediately said: "Sorry about that."</p><p>Phil added: "No, it's live, but don't worry, we love it."</p><p>Adam then joked: "At least you said giggles. There was happiness after it. Sorry, everybody."</p><p>Viewers called the moment the highlight of an otherwise very awkward interview.</p><p>Adam and Jennifer play hapless private detectives Nick and Audrey Spitz in the flick and face the biggest challenge of their short careers after their billionaire pal is abducted at his own wedding.</p><p><a href=#>Holly&nbsp;</a>and Phil are big fans of the Murder Mystery sequel, telling their guests that they watched it last night.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Mum-of-three Holly said she watched it with her two eldest and praised it for appealing to the whole family.</p><p>While Phillip branded it a "sugary" Glass Onion Agatha Christie hybrid, which appeared to please the A-listers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/adam-sandler-steps-rarely-seen-806445482.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/adam-sandler-seen-taking-daughters-806446111.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/l-r-sunny-sandler-adam-650349505.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2p9d4SXaJidmZ1iwKK6w6Wcq6tdma62s8etnKurXaiupbXEZpinnF2owq%2B62Gasp6qVmLyousizoJuklWK7psOMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christopher-w-mayer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Christopher W.
