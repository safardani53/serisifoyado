However, earlier in March, Holder uploaded a video on his YouTube channel announcing&nbsp;his mutual break up with Jordan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the video titled "Why we broke up...," both Holder and Jordan were seen sitting side by side. They&nbsp;explained how they had decided to bring their relationship to an end&nbsp;after dating each other for six months.</p><p>However, even after going public with their split, the two were frequently spotted in public spending time together. Naturally, it led to speculations of their reunion. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Taylor Holder and Charly Jordan's Break up</h2><p>The break up video started with Holder and Jordan shaking hands with each other.</p><p>Prior to making their announcement, Holder explained how he was too nervous to talk, but at the same time, he was quick to joke by saying, "Char cheated on me."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Holder later revealed to his audience that he was working on a reality show called House of Creators, and their break up was initially caught on camera during the show's filming. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, since the reality program would not be released immediately, the ex-couple decided to make it official before the rumors hit the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>In the particular episode, Holder was seen sobbing after he'd broken up with Jordan. But, during his coming together with his ex-girlfriend, Holder approached the subject matter in a sensible and mature manner.</p><p>Per Jordan, their relationship ended on good terms and claimed that there was "nothing bad" between them. She also spoke about how the two were living "super different lives right now." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"We love and support one another, but&nbsp;you know sometimes things do not always work out and that's okay. You need to end on a positive way," Jordan noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Tayler Holder Dating?</h2><p>Earlier in September, Jordan brushed aside the rumors of her and Holder dating each other after their eventual break up despite her many public sightings with Holder.&nbsp;</p><p>A peek into their respective Instagram accounts shows how they haven't&nbsp;deleted their pictures from the time they were dating each other. This has led many to speculate about their dating status.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, during her chat with The Hollywood Fix in September, Jordan revealed her relationship status to be single and told the reporter that she was "not dating anyone new" but was rather busy with her DJ career.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as Holder's current dating status is concerned, nothing concrete is known regarding the matter. But in the past, Holder&nbsp;had been in multiple relationships prior to dating Jordan.&nbsp;</p><p>The content creator was first known to be in a love affair with his ex-girlfriend <a href=# rel=follow>Kelianne Stankus</a> and later was publicly dating actress Kaylyn Slevin. However, both of his relationships ended prematurely.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In 2020, Holder was in a short-term relationship&nbsp;with his former girlfriend, <a href=# rel=follow>Sommer Ray</a>. However, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sportskeeda</a>, Holder's relationship with Sommer was largely unstable.</p><p>Their love affair couldn't last long, and the former pair decided to go their separate ways after dating each other for three months.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyRrrmmvoyhpqWclad6o77EmqJmraBjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sterling-k-brown-partners-with-stand-up-to-cancer-and-mastercard-help-fund-research.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sterling K.
