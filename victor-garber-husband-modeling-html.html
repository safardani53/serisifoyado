He&nbsp;confessed in an interview with the Skinny Arms that even though he was interested in art,&nbsp;he didn’t know how to make a career out of it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A student of Graphic Design, Andreesen&nbsp;was working in various advertising agencies in Vancouver when one of his clients approached him to take some photos for a modeling job, which later turned into a campaign for a department store.</p><p>The 58-year-old artist said that he didn't know he could model and gave credits to destiny — he was at the right place at the right time. His first job was to walk the runway for Giorgio Armani, and since then, Andreesen has been modeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to travel, and this opportunity was the perfect excuse. I ended up passing my design clients to another firm and spent the next two years traveling the world from my base in Italy.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After two years of working in Europe, the model moved to New York. Since then, he has worked and modeled for various brands and magazines. Having been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exposed</a> to many designers and styles,&nbsp;Andreesen knows what to wear and what suits him best. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Andreesen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed </a>that his future plans include painting and modeling for as long as he can and enjoying the journey. Currently, he is working with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three</a> modeling agencies — Wilhelmina, Heffner Management, and Richard’s Models.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Andreesen — The Artist&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The 58-year-old not only models, but he is also&nbsp;a talented artist&nbsp;known for his portraits. He has<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> been</a> doing watercolors since he was five&nbsp;and has been doing oil paints for over two&nbsp;decades.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, Andreesen described&nbsp;his style of art as classical portraiture. He confessed that his primary goal is to capture the likeness and spirit of the subject. His paintings have that effect of appearing realistic from a distance but abstract from near — the artist’s goal in the technical aspect.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Drawing inspiration from the things he sees and people he meets, the 58-year-old <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that the lighting and interest in his muses are the key ingredients in his portraits.&nbsp;Usually indulged in figurative and gray matter portraits, Andreesen’s paintings can be seen on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andreesen And His Husband,&nbsp;Victor Garber</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The model and artist has been with the Family Law actor for over 21 years. During the TV Critics Association Press Tour, Garber confirmed his relationship with Andreesen to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blogger</a> Greg Hernandez.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After 16 years of being together, the gay couple&nbsp;tied the knots in October 2015.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6u2pMDOq2SgmaKXsrN5x66qm5memXquu8Oeo6Kml2O1tbnL</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gavin-casalegno.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gavin Casalegno Biography">&larr;
