She subsequently made her significant film debut in films such as Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) and Punchline (1989). (1988). Her big role, however, was in the ABC comedy Full House as D.J. Tanner, Danny Tanner’s oldest daughter (played by Bob Saget).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Candace-Cameron-Bure-3.jpg alt="candace cameron bure" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>2) Candace Cameron Bure is a novelist.</h2><p>Candace Cameron Bure is a published novelist in addition to her considerable acting career in television films.
