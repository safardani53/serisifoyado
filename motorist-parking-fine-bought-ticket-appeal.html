So, we were just going out as a family to cheer ourselves up ahead of that happening, but it's all been a kick in the teeth."</p><p>Eleanor has stood her ground and will appeal the fine after she claims that she has correctly paid for her ticket and supplied all relevant evidence to appeal.</p><p>Despite regularly contacting Britannia Parking as well as the company who distributes the payment machines, she feels that her appeal is not being heard and says she is "stuck".</p><p>She feels her situation is unique after taking to <a href=#>social media</a> in the hopes that the someone else might have experienced the same thing, only to find no-one else had.</p><p>She said: "I posted in a local group because there was someone in front of me and someone behind me, so if it was a machine glitch, it would have been more than just a single transaction, it would have been multiple transactions, but that doesn't seem to be the case."</p><p>Eleanor's banking app shows the wrong name of the car park as name of payment, however the time and date of the payment is correct and in line with the ticket she purchased originally.</p><p>But because the name of payment differs to Britannia Parking, Eleanor claims that the parking company are unable to help with her enquiry.</p><h2>'NOT WILLING TO ENGAGE'</h2><p>She said: "Even in my appeal, I've said that I've made the payments, but the payments have gone somewhere else. They don't seem to understand the situation themselves because they've told me they do not know this place and that they're not affiliated with any local company."</p><p>However, Eleanor makes clear that she purchased the ticket from the machines inside the Britannia Parking car park on the premises. She says that because everything was completed digitally, she finds herself in a "difficult position".</p><p>"We don't have the paper ticket. So I don't know whether they're just gonna say without that there's no evidence," she said.</p><p>Eleanor even went to the machine distributor to find out if there was a specific issue with the payment machine as a different means to try and resolved the issue. But she was met with another brick wall with this enquiry.</p><p>"I've contacted the manufacturer that distribute the actual physical machine, and they're refusing to disclose anything because I'm not the client tenure car parking," Eleanor said.</p><p>She argues that the situation with Britannia Parking is frustrating as she feels there has been no support for her appeal. "This is what I find the hardest is when I've explained the issue and explained it clearly supplied all the evidence," she said.</p><p>"They're not willing to engage or take anything other than their explanation that 'oh no, you've done something wrong'."</p><p>She added that the parking company has not been helpful in escalating or dealing with the appeal.</p><p>Eleanor said: "They didn't even enquire, they didn't even try and understand what I was saying. They just provided a stock reply saying 'We're not affiliated with local businesses'".</p><h2>'OUT OF MY CONTROL'</h2><p>Eleanor claims that she has thought of every possible scenario to see if she had mistakenly done something wrong when purchasing the ticket, but claims that the situation is "out of her control".</p><p>She explained: "I couldn't have foreseen it.</p><p>"If there was something that has flashed on the screen, and it says 'can you confirm you're in this car park?' and I'd ignore that, you'd probably think there might not be any point challenging that, but it's none of that.</p><p>"At no point could I have possibly known that my payment has been allocated to the wrong location. At least that's how I understand the situation."</p><p>She argues: "I don't have £60 to spend on a fine that I didn't incur. Appealing is a lot of time and effort, and it takes up a lot of headspace."</p><p>A spokesman for Britannia Parking said that it "takes all concerns about our site very seriously".</p><p>They said: "The Poole Quayside car park is a surface site operating on a pay on arrival system and is long-established in our portfolio of sites.</p><p>"Payment for parking can be made by card at the pay machines, or by using the pay by phone service and following instructions provided within the car park. Customers are advised to take care to ensure the correct site code is used when making payment using pay by phone.</p><p>“In the event that a customer receives a parking charge notice, full details of the appeals process are provided on the reverse."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>They added: "Britannia Parking is a responsible car park operator and manager of 30 years’ standing. We take all concerns about our sites very seriously.</p><p>"We are a member of the British Parking Association and operate strictly in accordance with the industry’s Approved Operators Code of Conduct."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzfJJtcHJwZWS6sMDOq6CsrF2lrrO3yKeeZp6Zo7Jurs6unqGsXam2pLfErWSaqKCarq17</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./miley-cyrus-really-might-be-dating-douglas-booth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus Really Might Be Dating Douglas Booth">&larr;
