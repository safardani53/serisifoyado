"The low maintenance required is also a big draw. People love them because they usually don't require constant scrubbing or fixing. You can leave them out and have a cozy space to relax with friends and family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To put these chairs to the test (we're dubbing it "Operation Lounge"), we gathered teammates who wanted to sit on something besides an office chair for the day. We tested each Adirondack chair for qualities like setup, design, overall comfort and durability to see which ones stood out from the rest, and we continued testing the chairs for six more months at home.

We loved the lumbar support and the slanted design because it let us to sit at a comfortable angle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Setup proved slightly challenging since there were minimal instructions, but assembly took about 20 minutes, so it's not an insurmountable task. This Adirondack chair earned high marks in design, comfort, and support. The polywood material is highly durable, resistant to splinters, cracking, peeling, and other weather concerns. It also held up nicely against the stickier tests involving melted marshmallows and barbecue sauce. After a little work with a wet paper towel and a dab of dish soap, there was no leftover residue or stains on the chair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this is a simple chair (no special features like adjustability or cup holders), the flat, wide arms allow for easy beverage placement and provide a nice spot to let your arms lounge. The chair also passed our water-resistance test, with water from the hose beading immediately and easily wiping off. We were able to sit immediately without getting our clothing wet, a bonus for those living in rainy climates. Overall, we think this is a solid chair for modern or traditional-style backyards, and it will be a staple in that yard and essential <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>summer outdoor gear</a> for many years to come; it's a chair you can grow old in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up</strong>: We tested this Adirondack chair for six months at home, and we didn't go easy on it.

An immediate bonus: It comes completely assembled, and the plastic material was fairly smooth for sitting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This affordable Adirondack chair survived all of our tests, with every messy ingredient wiping off with ease. The material isn't scratch-proof but didn't suffer any damage after throwing a medicine ball at it. It held steady, though we noticed slight rocking when the ball was thrown. Its light weight makes it a breeze to move around, and the gray color is a nice neutral that blends in with most landscapes. When sitting, we noticed good lumbar support, which made it comfortable for long periods of lounging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the chair doesn't have any extra features and isn't adjustable, it's still a good value — the perfect spot for reading, lounging, and soaking up the sun (at a good price).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong> While home-testing this chair over six months, it did get knocked over by strong winds a few times, but it held up against other inclement weather like rain, hail, snow, and more. We still stand behind this recommendation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Adjustable: </strong>No |<strong> Material: </strong>Plastic |<strong> Water-Resistant: </strong>Yes | <strong>Foldable:</strong> No | <strong>Available Colors:</strong> 1</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="RealComfort Resin Plastic Adirondack Chair" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4ryGsOogN91rK0Grozc8W2KJ9gI=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Web_4000-PEO_RealComfortCharcoalResinPlasticAdirondackChair_06GW_011-21969564c6444e32b5dfa5a1255f6d73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Grant Webster</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3468 data-sizes=750px alt="RealComfort Resin Plastic Adirondack Chair" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AL5ecMqk1Er6Ipxp8qoXYPVsUQs=/fit-in/1500x3468/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AdirondackChairs_RealComfortCharcoalResinPlasticAdirondackChair_10_RM.jpg-5f9d64946fb9494ea6863eec9960aa81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Rachel Marek</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-highwood-hamilton-folding--reclining-adirondack-chair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Highwood Folding & Reclining Adirondack Chair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Highwood Hamilton Folding &amp;amp; Reclining Adirondack Chair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a2S0pBIgjdUjVD7WjfYuhQWER8g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Highwood-Hamilton-Folding--Reclining-Adirondack-Chair-48675107fc0b43fd99a9a26f27039151.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a chair that moves with you, look no further than this Adirondack chair from Highwood. Almost foolproof to set up, this chair was assembled in less than 15 minutes. Its smooth texture and wide base makes it comfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. But what really makes this chair stand out is its adjustability: It offers three different reclining positions, though it does take time to adjust it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Adirondack chair can hold up to tough messes because during the cleaning test, the marshmallow and barbecue sauce came off with a wet paper towel and a little bit of elbow grease. It also dried rapidly after the water test, and our team could sit on it immediately without getting our clothes wet. Overall, this is a well-designed chair that offers durability and easy maintenance, and though there aren't extras like cup holders, it's worth the investment price. Plus, it's made from recycled materials which we love, and it has that signature Adirondack design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up: </strong>We're still impressed with the performance of this chair after six months of home-testing, but we did store it inside for winter and noticed it doesn't fold as flat as we'd hoped. That said, we're still fans of this Adirondack chair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Adjustable: </strong>Yes |<strong> Material: </strong>Recycled plastics designed to look like wood |<strong> Water-Resistant: </strong>Yes | <strong>Foldable:</strong> Yes | <strong>Available Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plastic-yefu-plastic-adirondack-chair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Plastic</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yefu Plastic Adirondack Chair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Yefu Plastic Adirondack Chair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pri50qOyJMD7mGxrS0oxYL_utIA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yefu-plastic-adirondack-chair-baaf717f8d3b4c7a90e34f12dba438b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Adjustability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team swooned over this chair — the design, the appearance and feel of real wood, and the overall look. Plus, the arms are wide enough to hold objects without cup holders, which can sometimes take away from design. Setup only took 30 minutes; the instructions were clear, parts were labeled, and tools were included. Comfort-wise, this chair earned high ratings. We noted that the recline supports your back well and can be adjusted slightly for different sitting positions. Though, while the deep slant of the seat is relaxing for some, it could pose a challenge for older individuals with mobility issues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, our team had no problems cleaning this chair, although it did suffer some scuff marks after the medicine ball impact test. It dried quickly after being hosed off, and is very lightweight — meaning it's easy to move around, but could be blown over by strong winds. Overall, we like the look and general durability of this plastic option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up: </strong>After six months of home-testing, we still think this chair looks brand new.

This teak chair earned high scores during testing for its design, sturdiness, and level of comfort. We liked the height for sitting purposes; it wasn't too low to the ground. The structure of the chair provides a sturdy base and wide arms for placing drinks and other items. The natural teak wood looks chic but isn't stained, so it has to be sanded regularly to stay in peak condition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were impressed with how easy the marshmallow and barbecue sauce mess could be cleaned off the chair, and how quickly it dried after rinsing off with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>garden hose</a>. We wish it were adjustable, but that's not a dealbreaker. We also want to note that the lack of staining can cause it to change colors slightly over time. Given the regular maintenance, the price could be high for some budgets, but we appreciate the overall value and classic look of this teak wood Adirondack chair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up: </strong>This chair has held up over time, too; throughout six months of home-testing, it's still in excellent condition, and the teak wood looks fantastic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Adjustable: </strong>No |<strong> Material: </strong>Teak wood |<strong> Water-Resistant: </strong>Mostly | <strong>Foldable:</strong> No | <strong>Available Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foldable-eccb-outdoor-outer-banks-deluxe-oversized-poly-lumber-folding-adirondack-chair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Foldable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ECCB Outdoor Outer Banks Folding Adirondack Chair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ECCB Outdoor Outer Banks Deluxe Oversized Poly Lumber Folding Adirondack Chair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iRs-0pOzF0fO7MfPVKZ1ntLHnK4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eccb-deluxe-oversized-poly-lumber-folding-adirondack-chair-09e2031ac71a451a97d5c5c3516785cf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Outer Banks-inspired Adirondack chair offers a classic design and a frame that's sturdy, comfortable, and foldable for easy storage. Regarding comfort, we think the chair is spacious with comfortable armrests that sit at a good height and position. The seat is wide enough to lounge in, and all the surfaces are smooth against your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though setup presented challenges via a defective screw, the assembly was pretty straightforward. It would have been nice to have additional tools to secure the bolts in the chair better. The structure was very solid and scored well in our testing for durability. The back of this Adirondack chair has a scalloped design on the top edge, and there are cup holders with a special notched perch for stemmed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wine glasses</a>. It aced our cleaning tests with all messes coming off with a wet paper towel. The chair isn't adjustable, but that doesn't detract from its great qualities.

That said, we appreciated the extra set of screws, labeled parts, and detailed instructions. We noticed the back isn't as slanted as other Adirondack chairs, which could be beneficial to those with shorter legs. The acacia wood is also super smooth, which makes for a pleasant sitting experience, free of splinters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, the chair withstood multiple 15-pound medicine balls being thrown at it — an impressive feat, considering it didn't tip over or break. Though a folding chair, this one stays in place when open, so you don't have to worry about it folding in on you while sitting. It's lightweight, which makes it quite portable should you need a chair on the go. It's not adjustable, but the wood is sturdy, easy to clean, durable, and water-resistant. Considering the price, this chair is a great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up: </strong>In regards to home-testing, this chair was tested on a porch rather than outside in the elements, so it hasn't had to weather too much yet.

They're also wide enough to place a drink, book, or your phone. Though the chair doesn't adjust or fold, we liked the overall design.

Considering that, you'll want a highly durable chair — like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">L.L. Bean All Weather Adirondack Chair</a>. A durable Adirondack chair can hold up to rain, gusts of wind, extreme sunlight (in terms of staining the color), bugs, and general wear and tear from kids, pets, flying objects and toys, and any activities that take place in a backyard. Finding a sturdy chair with a solid structure will ensure many years of use. Burns says it depends on "the quality of the chair and outdoor elements it's exposed to," but that a well-made chair can last up to 20 years.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort Level</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adirondack chairs have a unique design, and while they look gorgeous in backyards, they're not always conducive to those with long legs. The front of the chair is very low to the ground, so if you are tall, you should keep in mind that these types of chairs may not be comfortable for extended periods of time. That being said, the seats are generally supportive as the reclined back position provides mild lumbar support and plenty of room to lounge. We love the comfort factor in our best overall pick: the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">POLYWOOD Modern Adirondack Chair</a><strong>.</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the chair's durability (as well as comfort) depends on the material of the Adirondack chair. "Look for weather-resistant materials to ensure longevity," says Burns. "Durable, weather-resistant materials like poly lumber are great for being able to hold up outdoors year after year." If you want a more sophisticated design, teak wood — found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Grandin Road All-Natural Teak Adirondack Chair</a> — provides stability, holds up against bugs and inclement weather, and is generally smooth on the skin when sitting. Plastic or recycled materials have a more casual appearance but offer similar durability and comfort when in use. Burns also cautions to "pay close attention to the thickness of the boards. Chairs made with thinner boards can lead to the chair wearing out or breaking at a quicker pace."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-adirondack-chairs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Adirondack Chairs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rachel Marek</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team tested 23 top-rated Adirondack chairs.

We measured how long the setup took, and how much labor was involved, as well as the quality of materials and hardware. We judged how each chair looked and what features it came with (if any). Settling into the chair, our team rated each on how comfortable, adjustable, and supportive they were. We also examined the durability, checking for any unsteadiness when pushed and seeing how the chair held up against impacts (like a medicine ball tossed onto the seat). To test ease of cleaning, we smeared melted marshmallows and barbecue sauce on the arms, then cleaned the mess off after letting it sit for 10 minutes. We also brought the chairs outside and hosed each one off to determine how they held up to water, and how quickly they dried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After our lab test, we continued testing these chairs at home for six months.

However, it's best to cover the chairs for added protection during extended periods of inclement weather. Adirondack chairs made of wood are more susceptible to the elements. If the chairs are well-sealed, they can withstand some bouts of precipitation but will last longer if protected with a cover or stored in a garage or patio.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you maintain an Adirondack chair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific guidance.

And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ikuqZ7wZ6qrWWRmbazu82dmJyjXZi1orXRrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fire-wet-drayton-huge-blaze-heathrow-trains.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="West Drayton fire  London Paddington trains cancelled after huge blaze at coal depot sends black ">&larr;
