Continue reading this article to learn more about her daughter Sue Vertue and Debbie Grief.&nbsp;Beryl Frances Vertue CBE was born on April 8, 1931, and died on February 12, 2022, peacefully. In the United Kingdom, she worked as a television producer, media executive, and former agent.&nbsp;Her company, Hartswood Films, is an independent television production company that she started and chairs.&nbsp;Beryl had a remarkable career behind the scenes of some of TV’s most successful programs, shaking shoulders with a plethora of Hollywood stars. She has a string of popular comedies under her credit, including Steptoe And Son, Is It Legal? and Coupling.</p><h2>Who Is Beryl Vertue’s Husband?</h2><p>There isn’t much information available on Beryl’s spouse on the internet. The specifics of her marriage were unknown at the time of her death. No basic information regarding her husband’s or partner’s identity has been disclosed as of yet.&nbsp;We do, however, have some information regarding the late Beryl Vertus that our readers may be interested in.&nbsp;According to her Wikipedia page, she received the Alan Clarke Award for Outstanding Creative Contribution to Television from the British Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (BAFTA) in 2004.</p><p>On March 20, 2012, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Television Society Program Awards, and on March 30, 2012, she received the Harvey Lee Award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting from the BPG TV and Radio Awards.&nbsp;On January 25, 2013, Vertue appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. She passed away on February 12, 2022, at the age of 90.&nbsp;“We had to share the dreadful news that mum/Beryl passed away gently last night,” her two children stated in a statement.&nbsp;“It wasn’t Covid enough is enough, but rather her almost 91-year-old body.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Beryl-Vertue-3.jpg alt="Beryl Vertue" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Everything Depends on Daughter Debbie and Sue Vertue</h2><p>Vertue’s two daughters are Sue and Debbie Vertue. Susan Nicola Vertue was born on September 21, 1960, in Surrey. She is a television producer from England best known for her work on Mr. Bean and Coupling.&nbsp;Her spouse is Steven Moffat, the writer, and producer of Doctor Who and Sherlock.&nbsp;Debbie started her career as a runner before advancing through the ranks of assistant director on films, television series, and commercials to become Hartswood Films’ Director of Operations and Head of Production.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Beryl-Vertue-2.jpg alt="Beryl Vertue" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Debbie considers herself fortunate to be a member of the PG, which has a strong film and television membership. She also serves on the Pact business affairs council and the Creative Skillset High-End TV committee.&nbsp;They must have been heartbroken by their mother’s death. It must be a difficult time for the family now that one of their favorite television creators has died.&nbsp;We support her family and extend our heartfelt condolences to the lovely woman. May her soul find peace.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Andy Vermaut shares:Beryl Vertue: TV producer behind Men Behaving Badly and Shelock dies at 90: Her daughters pay tribute to the “mentor and giggle-maker” who made Men Behaving Badly and Sherlock. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/8JiQTnjp3Z</a> Thank you <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/T0MiTmOIK2</a></p><p>— Andy Vermaut (@AndyVermaut) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2022</a></p><h2>What was the television producer’s net worth? Beryl Vertue Net Worth</h2><p>There is a lot of conflicting information about Beryl’s net worth on the internet. Some media believe she has a net worth of ten million dollars, while others claim she has a net worth of more than 240 million dollars.&nbsp;It’s impossible to estimate her net worth right now since neither the producer nor her daughter has ever discussed it. However, given her job as a television producer, she couldn’t have had only $10 million. Nonetheless, we are trying everything necessary to get information on her wealth so that we may update our readers as soon as possible.&nbsp;Please stick with us till that moment arrives.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqqpoXq3sdGtrJ5loJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxyZ2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./food-and-wine-classic-2023-photos-of-chefs-and-celebrities-7550563.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Food &amp;amp; Wine Classic 2023 Photos of Chefs and Celebrities">&larr;
