However, being a global superstar with a legion of fans, the “Chemical” artist was sure to have some of them digging for the 411. Not much is floating around about Post’s woman, as she has reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>deactivated her Instagram account</a>, but what we do know is that his groupies have landed on calling the mystery woman “Jamie.”</p><h2>When Did Post Malone and His Fiancée Start Dating?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>It appears Post and his lady love became an item sometime in 2020, although there are only a handful of rare sightings of the couple together through the years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The pair initially had fans in a frenzy when they were photographed together at an airport back in October 2022, as seen on this fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a>. From then on, the couple had a few other public sightings, like one in West Hollywood during a shopping spree. The pair looked like they were having a blast getting in some retail therapy, as Post was all smiles, as seen in photos here on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Prior to that, in August 2021, the “Sunflower” singer and Jamie attended his cousin’s wedding in New York, according to this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fan account.</a><span> Post was rocking a shirt and tie as he had his arm around Jamie, who wore a simple black dress. The pair were also snapped at a Magic: The Gathering cards event in Phoenix in October of 2021, where they had a blast with a big group of friends, as seen <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</span><b></b></p><h2>When Was Post Malone’s Daughter Born?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In June 2022, Post casually revealed to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howard Stern</strong> </a>on the shock jock’s show that he is the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> proud father</a> of a baby girl.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I woke up at 2:30 in the afternoon. I went and I kissed my baby girl,” he said during the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a>. Howard quickly asked him to expand, saying “Baby girl — are you referring to your girlfriend? Or, you have a baby?” The rapper answered, “No, that’s my daughter.” The confused radio star asked, “That’s been on the QT [quiet] though? We didn’t know you had a daughter, right?” to which the rapper quipped, “Yeah, I want her to make her own decisions. That’s it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a> reported that the “White Iverson” artist’s daughter was born in May 2022.</p><h2>When Did Post Malone Get Engaged?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>During the interview with Howard, Post also confirmed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he’s engaged</a> to his baby mama. “She’s my fiancée,” he explained. No other news of their upcoming nuptials, such as date or location, have been announced. Before proposing to Jamie, Post was previously linked to Korean visual artist/singer <strong>MLMA</strong> (“Me Love Me A lot”) for a brief period in 2020. He also dated <strong>Ashlen Diaz</strong> for three years before they split in November of 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Post opened up to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Call Her Daddy</a> podcast host <strong>Alex Cooper </strong>about his relationship on August 1. In the candid interview, he revealed that he proposed to his fiancée in Las Vegas the year prior.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“We’re not married – it was just a proposal,” the “Mourning” artist explained. “I had lost a significant amount of money at the table. We go upstairs and I’m off my rocker hammered and I was like, ‘Hey, you wanna marry me?’ I got a ring and all this stuff. And she said ‘no.’ She’s like, ‘Ask me tomorrow’ and I was like, ‘Alright.’ And then I did and I was sober and it was nice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>He went on to gush over his leading lady and called her the “best” mother. “I could tell … her heart is so massive,” he said of knowing his fiancée was “the one” prior to the engagement. “I’ve always wanted kids and a big family. And I could tell she was going to be a really good mama. And she’s like, No. 1 mom in the f***ing universe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2Boqq1lnZa5sLrEZq6inpVignGBj3JsbWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-christian-okoye-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Christian Okoye Dating Now">&larr;
