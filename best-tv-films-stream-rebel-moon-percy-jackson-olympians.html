Drawing together a small but determined band of warriors - including pilot Kai (<a href=#>Charlie Hunnan</a>) and former legendary commander General Titus (<a href=#>Djimon Hounsou</a>) - Kora prepares to fight against seemingly impossible odds. Breathing new life into an overstuffed genre like sci-fi is a tough ask, and Rebel Moon is clearly a close cousin of everything from Star Wars to Dune, with a little Lord Of The Rings thrown in. But if anyone can put a shiny, effects-laden and exciting new spin on all that’s come before, it’s director <a href=#>Zack Snyder</a> (Man Of Steel, 300: Rise Of An Empire).</p><p><strong>Maestro</strong> - Available from Wednesday</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON NETFLIX">READ MORE ON NETFLIX</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/director-writer-producer-maestro-cr-861565112-1.jpg><p>There was a real buzz from the moment it was revealed that <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> was writing a script about the life and loves of legendary American composer and conductor <a href=#>Leonard Bernstein</a>. Even more so when it was confirmed he’d be directing and starring in the resulting movie. Now here is that film, an epic, sweeping exploration of Bernstein’s complex, lifelong relationship with celebrated Broadway actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein, played by <a href=#>Carey Mulligan</a>. While not without controversy – the prosthetic nose Bradley wears to become Bernstein has been criticised by some – the film boasts impressive performances from the leads, painstaking attention to period detail and lots of wonderful music, and it’s sure to be in the running come awards season.</p><p><strong>Gyeongseong Creature</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gyeongseong-creature-s1-han-so-861564012-1.jpg><p>Anyone already feeling a little fatigued by all the festive cheer should definitely check out this dark, horror-flavoured new drama from South Korea. Set in 1945, when Korea was under Japanese rule, the series introduces viewers to two young people, the wealthy and powerful Jang Tae-Sang (Park Seo-Joon) and renowned detective Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee), who has a gift for tracking down missing people. Together, they embark on a series of missing person cases in the city of Gyeongseong (which is now known as Seoul), only to discover a terrible, monstrous creature that threatens their survival. The 10-part series is divided into two drops, the first seven episodes landing this week, with the remaining three due on 5 January.</p><p><strong>Supa Team 4</strong> - Available from Thursday</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/namisa-mdlalose-monde-nancy-sekhokoane-861564172.jpg><p>The first season of this action-packed, kids’ superhero show from South African was major news, as it was Netflix’s first African animated series. Following the thrilling adventures of four butt-kicking teenage girls recruited by a retired secret agent to help save the world, the show is big, bold and exciting, and comes armed with some important messages about the environment. Following the success of the series, here comes an equally exhilarating movie spin-off. This time, the gang – Komana, Monde, Temwe and Zee – are on a mission to find elusive, powerful supervillain Chusi. Meanwhile, the shadowy Mr Magedzee is hunting for a greener power source.</p><p><strong>Trevor Noah: Where Was I</strong> - Available from Tuesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/i-wish-trevor-noah-toronto-861564193.jpg><p>Trevor, the former host of The Daily Show, has kept himself very busy since leaving that American institution late last year. Indeed, the South African comedian has spent much of 2023 touring the world with his latest stand-up show, performing everywhere from India to Berlin, Dubai to London. But if you’ve not been able to bag a ticket to see him in the flesh, never fear because the show has been recorded and is coming to Netflix this week. Filmed at the Fox Theatre in Detroit, the routine takes in observations form Trevor’s extensive global travels and finds him on typically edgy and energetic form.</p><p><strong>Cindy la Regia: The High School Years</strong> - Available from Wednesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gustavo-cruz-juancho-michelle-pellicer-861564183.jpg><p>Teenager Cindy (Michelle Pellicer) has set her sights high in life. But before she can realise her dreams, there’s the small matter of navigating the emotional obstacle course that is high school – and the limiting expectations of the upscale San Pedro Garza Garcia society in which she lives. Supported by her BFFs Lu and Tere, and her recently arrived cousin Angie, can Cindy overcome the pressures of teenage life? Serving as a prequel to the 2020 movie Cindy la Regia, this Mexican coming of age comedy drama proves that issues of growing up, teenage romance and identity translate into every language. In Spanish, with subtitles.</p><p><strong>Disney+</strong></p><p><strong>Percy Jackson And The Olympians</strong> - Available from Wednesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861148482.jpg><p>The stupendously popular Percy Jackson series of books, which recount the adventures of 12-year-old modern-day demi-god Percy, has been thrilling young readers for almost 20 years. Now, the first book - The Lightning Thief - has been turned into a spectacular TV series by Disney, with Walker Scobell in the lead role. Youngster Percy is just coming to terms with the astounding news that he’s a demi-god, when the all-powerful Zeus accuses him of stealing his precious Lightning Bolt. Assisted by his friends, Grover and Annabeth, can Percy find it, save himself and restore order to Olympus?</p><p><strong>What If…?</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/season-2-see-pa-feature-867058507.jpg><p>The first season of this animated sci-fi series was a real treat for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, putting new spins on old favourites and imagining what might have happened if key events in movies such as The Avengers, Black Panther and Thor had played out differently. The show returns this week, promising another batch of imaginative and action-packed hypotheticals, which will involve a host of much-loved characters, including Dr Strange, Nebula and the dastardly Hela. With loads of big-name actors from the original movies lending their voices, Jeffrey Wright narrating as The Watcher and some very impressive graphics, it promises to be immense. And if all that isn’t exciting enough, Disney+ will be dropping a new episode every day for nine days.</p><p><strong>Apple TV+</strong></p><p><strong>A Charlie Brown Christmas</strong> - Available from Saturday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/charlie-brown-christmas-865632651.jpg><p>First released way back in 1965, A Charlie Brown Christmas is a solid-gold and much-loved classic seasonal treat. It finds Charlie feeling rather depressed about the commercialisation of Christmas - yes, they worried about that even as far back as the 60s. But still, he sets about directing the gang’s Christmas play and attempt to find the perfect Christmas tree. Wry, sweet and beautifully animated, it’s a nostalgic seasonal treat for the whole family. And as a little early Christmas present, the special will be available for everyone – even if you don’t have an Apple TV+ subscription - to stream free on both Saturday and Sunday.</p><p><strong>Sago Mini Friends</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000862371980.jpg><p>Great news for all pre-schoolers, not to mention their parents, because here comes an all-new seasonal special of the delightful kids’ animation. Loveable Harvey the dog is back along with all his friends - Jinja the cat, Jack the rabbit and Robin the bird - and they’re about to have another unforgettable adventure. It’s New Year’s Eve and Harvey is desperate to stay awake until midnight. As he makes a wish, a firefly glides in to help - and sets Harvey and the gang off on an exciting scavenger hunt. As ever, there are some important, positive lessons learned along the way, subtly hidden among a whole heap of fun.</p><p><strong>Discovery+</strong></p><p><strong>Gwyneth vs Terry: The Ski Crash Trial</strong> - Available from Monday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gwyneth-paltrow-speaks-retired-optometrist-865131544.jpg><p>It was one of the most unexpected but talked-about court cases of the year: globally famous Hollywood star <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> being sued by <a href=#>retired optometrist Terry Sanderson</a>. This surprising legal battle, which resulted in a remarkable eight-day trial, began <a href=#>back in 2016 when Gwyneth and Terry collided while they were skiing</a> at an exclusive Utah ski resort. Claiming serious injury, Terry decided to sue Gwyneth, who he blamed for the accident but who maintained her innocence throughout. This new film examines the case from both sides and features exclusive access to one of the jurors and key witnesses. A seriously juicy documentary.</p><p><strong>Paramount+</strong></p><p><strong>Simple Minds: Everything Is Possible</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000862374140.jpg><p>This new documentary film charts the Scottish band’s long and eventful history, from formation in 1977, through their stadium-filling days in the 1980s and 90s - which included a performance at the US leg of Live Aid - and all the way on to their status today as bona fide British rock legends. Featuring interviews with founders and remaining original members Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill, plus critics and fans, it’s a fascinating history of one of the most successful bands of the last 40 years.</p><p><strong>Finestkind</strong> - Available from Saturday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tommy-lee-jones-ray-lolita-862374383.jpg><p>Half-brothers Tom (Ben Foster), who’s a fisherman, and Charlie (Toby Wallace), a risk-taker who’s drifted into a life of crime, have very little in common. Having spent much of their lives apart, when the pair reunite as adults, desperate circumstances force them to make a potentially dangerous deal with a Boston crime gang. But when a mysterious young woman, Mabel (Jenna Ortega), comes into their lives, it causes complications that force them to make some terrifying sacrifices. Also starring Tommy Lee Jones as the brothers’ father, Eldridge, this is a windswept and impressive thriller about the strength of family ties.</p><p><strong>ITVX</strong></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><strong>My Mom, Your Dad US</strong><strong> </strong>- Available from Thursday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000862374834.jpg><p>The British version of this heart-warming dating show, which gives young adults the chance to play Cupid for their middle-aged single parents, was a hit when it arrived on our screens back in September. Now here comes the American take on the show, which follows the same pattern of bringing a group of singletons to a special romance retreat, where they’ll attempt to bond with each other, unaware that their kids are pulling the strings behind the scenes. Expect emotion and entertainment galore, with actress and stand-up comedian Yvonne Orji bringing insight and humour to proceedings as host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpkboZxfpVxZpudo6l6tcKMn6ClpaNiwLW%2BxJqkZqqVl7KtecyopqdloJq%2FpMWMo5ico6Oku267y7KkqaGRo8Bw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wendy-schmidt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wendy Schmidt">&larr;
